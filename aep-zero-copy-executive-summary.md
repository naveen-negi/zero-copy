# AEP Zero-Copy Architecture: Executive Summary

**Document Purpose**: Strategic decision guide for integrating BigQuery lead scoring with Adobe Experience Platform while minimizing data transfer and vendor lock-in.

**Context**: You have cold/warm/hot lead classification models running in BigQuery. You need to activate these audiences to marketing channels (Marketo, Google Ads, etc.) via AEP.

**Target Audience**: Executives and decision-makers who need to choose an approach, not implement it.

**Last Updated**: October 2025 (based on latest Adobe Experience Platform documentation)

## Executive Summary

### The Challenge

Your organization faces a strategic decision: how to leverage Adobe Experience Platform's activation capabilities without creating massive data transfer volumes, operational complexity, or irreversible vendor lock-in.

The traditional AEP approach requires copying ALL customer data into Adobe's Real-Time Customer Profile - potentially hundreds of terabytes annually with significant cost and risk implications.

### The Opportunity

Adobe's 2024/2025 release of **Federated Audience Composition** fundamentally changes the economics and architecture. True zero-copy is now possible for audience-based use cases like lead classification.

### Top 4 Options

After comprehensive analysis of 6 architecture patterns, four emerge as viable for your BigQuery lead scoring use case:

1. **Federated Audience Composition (RECOMMENDED)** - Query BigQuery directly from AEP, transfer only audience IDs
2. **Computed Attributes Pattern** - Send only derived scores to AEP, not raw data
3. **Hybrid Selective Pattern** - Combine federated audiences (99% of use cases) with real-time computed attributes (1% of use cases)
4. **External Audiences (CSV/API Upload)** - Build audiences in BigQuery, upload ID lists manually (best for POC/testing)

### Quick Decision Matrix

| Decision Factor | Choose Federated Audience Composition | Choose Computed Attributes | Choose Hybrid | Choose External Audiences |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Your primary need is... | Batch campaign activation (daily/weekly) | Real-time triggers (<1 min) OR need AEP AI features | Both batch campaigns AND real-time alerts | POC/testing or one-time campaigns |
| Data sovereignty is... | Critical (data must stay in GCP) | Important but flexible | Critical for most data, flexible for minimal real-time subset | Medium (IDs copied to AEP) |
| Budget for AEP... | Cost-conscious ($247K-$701K/year) | Moderate ($248K-$858K/year) | Higher ($286K-$693K/year) | Lowest ($112K-$292K/year) |
| Vendor lock-in risk tolerance... | Low (keep logic in BigQuery) | Medium (some AEP dependencies) | Low-Medium (mostly independent) | Very Low (just ID lists) |
| Time to implement... | 2-4 weeks | 4-8 weeks | 6-12 weeks | <1 week |
| Production readiness... | Full production | Full production | Full production | POC/testing only |

KEY BENEFITS:
✓ 99.96% data reduction (10 MB vs 2-10 TB)
✓ $247K-$701K/year (50% cost savings)
✓ 2-4 weeks implementation
✓ Zero vendor lock-in (all logic in BigQuery)
✓ Data never leaves GCP
```

### What It Is

Federated Audience Composition (FAC) is Adobe's 2024/2025 capability that allows AEP to query your BigQuery data warehouse DIRECTLY without copying data into Adobe's systems. You build audiences using a drag-and-drop UI that executes SQL queries against your BigQuery tables, then transfer only the resulting customer IDs to AEP for activation.

**Key Concept**: Your lead scoring models, raw data, and business logic remain entirely in BigQuery. AEP becomes a "thin activation layer" that queries your data and sends audience lists to marketing channels.

**How It Works** (conceptually):
- You configure a secure connection from AEP to your BigQuery project
- You create audience compositions in AEP's UI (similar to building SQL queries visually)
- AEP executes the query against BigQuery and retrieves ONLY customer IDs matching your criteria
- These IDs become an "External Audience" in AEP (30-day TTL by default)
- You activate this audience to destinations (Marketo, Google Ads, etc.)

**Data Transfer Volume**: If you have 10 million customers and 500,000 qualify as "hot leads", AEP transfers 500,000 customer IDs (~10-50 MB) instead of 10 million full profiles (~2-10 TB).

### Why It's the Best Choice for Your Use Case

**Strategic Advantages**:
1. **Zero Vendor Lock-in**: All scoring logic, models, and historical data stay in BigQuery under your control
2. **True Zero-Copy**: Data never leaves GCP; only audience membership IDs flow to AEP
3. **Cost Efficiency**: 50% lower AEP costs vs full profile ingestion ($41K-$83K/year vs $82K-$145K/year)
4. **Operational Simplicity**: No custom ETL pipelines, no data sync orchestration, no dual-write consistency issues
5. **Data Sovereignty**: Maintains compliance with data residency requirements (if applicable)
6. **Flexibility**: Can switch from AEP to competitors (Segment, mParticle, Braze) without data migration

**Technical Advantages**:
- Native BigQuery support (added 2025)
- Secure VPN connectivity to GCP
- No Profile Store ingestion costs
- No storage fees for customer data in AEP
- Simpler schema management (no complex XDM modeling required for source data)

### Key Benefits

1. **Minimal Data Transfer**: 99.96% reduction vs full profile ingestion
   - Traditional approach: 2-10 TB/year of profile data
   - Federated approach: 50 MB - 500 MB/year of audience IDs

2. **Cost Savings**: ~50% reduction in AEP operational costs
   - No profile ingestion API costs
   - No storage costs for full customer profiles
   - Lower complexity = lower operational overhead

3. **Faster Time to Value**: 2-4 weeks typical implementation
   - No complex ETL pipeline development
   - No XDM schema design for hundreds of fields
   - Configure connection, map fields, build compositions

4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth in BigQuery
   - Change scoring model → No AEP schema changes required
   - Add new segmentation criteria → Update BigQuery query only
   - No dual-system consistency management

5. **Portability**: Low switching costs if you outgrow AEP
   - Logic remains in your warehouse
   - Easy to point different activation platform at same BigQuery tables
   - No data extraction needed to change vendors

### Key Limitations

**Performance Constraints**:
- **Batch-only processing**: Minimum refresh typically hourly, standard is daily
- **No real-time streaming**: Cannot react to events in <1 minute
- **Query latency**: Audience compositions take 5-30 minutes to execute (depending on BigQuery query complexity)
- **No sub-100ms lookups**: Cannot power real-time web personalization

**Feature Limitations**:
- **No AEP Identity Graph**: Cannot leverage Adobe's cross-device identity stitching (must pre-compute in BigQuery)
- **No Customer AI / Attribution AI**: AEP's AI services require profile data in the Profile Store
- **No edge segmentation**: Cannot use audiences for Adobe Target edge decisions
- **Cannot delete audiences**: Known limitation in current version (audiences expire after TTL)

**Data Access Constraints**:
- Requires dedicated BigQuery dataset (cannot query your entire warehouse for security)
- Must allowlist AEP IP addresses for network access
- Authentication via service account key file (JSON)

**Licensing Requirements**:
- Requires Real-Time CDP (any tier)
- Requires Journey Optimizer Prime or Ultimate
- Requires Federated Audience Composition add-on SKU (separate purchase)

### When to Use This Option

**Ideal For**:
- Batch marketing campaigns (daily, weekly, monthly cadence)
- Lead nurturing workflows triggered on schedule
- Audience suppression lists (do not contact, already converted, etc.)
- Lookalike audience modeling (executed in BigQuery)
- Compliance-driven use cases requiring data residency
- Organizations with strong data engineering capabilities in BigQuery/GCP

**NOT Suitable For**:
- Real-time personalization on website (<100ms response time)
- Immediate sales alerts (<1 minute latency)
- Mobile app in-session experiences requiring instant profile lookup
- Use cases requiring Adobe's Customer AI or Attribution AI
- Scenarios requiring Adobe's Identity Graph for cross-device stitching

### Rough Cost Estimate

**AEP Licensing** (order of magnitude):
- Real-Time CDP (Foundation or Select): $100K-$300K/year base license
- Journey Optimizer Prime: $50K-$150K/year
- Federated Audience Composition add-on: $40K-$80K/year (estimated based on typical Adobe pricing)
- **Total AEP: $190K-$530K/year**

**GCP Costs** (incremental):
- BigQuery query costs for audience composition: $500-$5K/month depending on frequency
- VPN connection: ~$100/month
- Egress for audience IDs: Negligible (<$50/month)
- **Total GCP incremental: $7K-$61K/year**

**Implementation**:
- Initial setup: $20K-$50K (2-4 weeks consulting)
- Ongoing maintenance: 0.25-0.5 FTE (~$30K-$60K/year)

**Total First-Year Cost**: $247K-$701K (wide range depends on AEP tier and company size)

**Cost Comparison**: This is ~50% LOWER than full profile ingestion approach because:
- No profile ingestion API costs (eliminates $50K-$100K/year in streaming ingestion)
- No profile storage costs (eliminates $30K-$60K/year for 10M+ profiles)
- Simpler operations (reduces consulting/maintenance by 30-40%)

KEY BENEFITS:
✓ 85-95% data reduction (500 MB vs 50-100 GB/day)
✓ Real-time capability (2-10 min latency)
✓ Full AEP features (Customer AI, Identity Graph)
✓ $248K-$858K/year

KEY TRADE-OFFS:
⚠ Profiles stored in AEP (vendor lock-in)
⚠ Higher cost vs Option 1
⚠ Dual-system complexity
```

### What It Is

This pattern keeps your lead scoring computation in BigQuery but streams ONLY the derived results (scores, classifications, flags) to AEP as profile attributes. Instead of sending 100+ raw behavioral fields, you send 5-10 computed fields like "lead_classification: hot", "propensity_score: 0.87", "engagement_index: 42".

**Key Concept**: BigQuery is your "computation engine", AEP is your "profile store + activation layer". You pre-compute everything in BigQuery, then push minimal derived attributes to AEP for segmentation and activation.

**How It Works** (conceptually):
- BigQuery runs your lead scoring models (daily or hourly)
- A lightweight service reads scoring results and calls AEP's Streaming Ingestion API
- AEP stores minimal profiles with only computed attributes (not raw behavioral data)
- You create segments in AEP based on these attributes: "Hot Leads" WHERE lead_classification = "hot"
- Activate segments to destinations

**Data Transfer Volume**: For 10 million customers with 5 computed fields each, you stream ~500 MB/day instead of 50-100 GB/day of raw events.

### Why This Option Makes Sense

**Strategic Advantages**:
1. **Partial Vendor Lock-in Reduction**: Core logic stays in BigQuery, only segments depend on AEP
2. **Better Real-Time Support**: Can achieve <5 minute latency for score updates (vs hourly with FAC)
3. **Full AEP Feature Access**: Can use Customer AI, Attribution AI, Identity Graph, edge segmentation
4. **Simpler Segmentation**: Business users build segments in AEP UI without SQL knowledge

**Technical Advantages**:
- Supports streaming profile updates (not just batch)
- Enables real-time segment evaluation (<1 minute for streaming segments)
- Compatible with AEP's full destination catalog
- Can combine computed attributes with other AEP data sources

### Key Benefits

1. **Significant Data Reduction**: 85-95% less data vs full profile ingestion
   - Traditional: 100+ fields per profile, updated daily
   - Computed: 5-10 fields per profile, updated when scores change

2. **Low Latency Option**: Can achieve near-real-time updates
   - Stream score changes to AEP within 1-5 minutes
   - Segment evaluation completes within 1-5 minutes after profile update
   - Total latency: 2-10 minutes (vs hours for batch approaches)

3. **AEP Feature Compatibility**: Full platform access
   - Can use Customer AI for churn prediction alongside your custom scoring
   - Can leverage Adobe's Identity Graph for cross-device stitching
   - Can activate to edge destinations for Adobe Target

4. **Business User Friendly**: Segmentation without SQL
   - Marketing ops can build and modify segments in AEP UI
   - No need to write BigQuery SQL for each audience variation
   - Faster iteration on audience definitions

### Key Limitations

**Vendor Lock-in Risks**:
- **Segment logic in AEP**: If you switch from AEP, must rebuild segment definitions in new platform
- **Data schema coupling**: Your computed attributes become tightly coupled to AEP's XDM schema
- **Destination mappings**: Activations configured in AEP must be recreated if you migrate

**Cost Implications**:
- **Profile ingestion costs**: Pay for streaming API calls (~$0.10-$0.50 per 1,000 profiles)
- **Profile storage costs**: Pay for profiles in Real-Time Customer Profile Store
- **Higher AEP SKU**: Need larger profile limits even though profiles are minimal

**Operational Complexity**:
- **Dual-system management**: Must maintain both BigQuery scoring pipeline AND AEP profile sync
- **Schema evolution**: Changes to computed attributes require XDM schema updates AND code changes
- **Monitoring complexity**: Must monitor BigQuery jobs, sync services, AEP ingestion, segment evaluation

**Technical Constraints**:
- **Still requires data transfer**: Not true zero-copy (streams derived attributes)
- **Profile Store dependency**: Profiles must reside in AEP for segmentation
- **API rate limits**: Streaming ingestion limited to ~20K profiles/second per sandbox

### When to Use This Option

**Ideal For**:
- Real-time use cases requiring <5 minute latency (e.g., "sales rep alert when lead becomes hot")
- Scenarios requiring cross-device identity stitching via Adobe's Identity Graph
- Companies with existing AEP investments who want to reduce data volume but keep full feature access
- Web personalization use cases requiring fast profile lookups (<100ms)
- Organizations WITHOUT existing ML models that want to use AEP's Customer AI for propensity scoring (Note: Not applicable to your use case since you already have BigQuery ML models)

**NOT Suitable For**:
- Organizations with strict data sovereignty requirements (profiles still stored in Adobe)
- Cost-sensitive scenarios where FAC would be 50% cheaper
- Pure batch use cases where real-time latency provides no value
- Companies wanting to minimize vendor lock-in

### Rough Cost Estimate

**AEP Licensing**:
- Real-Time CDP (Select or Prime tier for larger profile counts): $150K-$400K/year
- Journey Optimizer (optional): $50K-$150K/year
- **Total AEP: $150K-$550K/year**

**AEP Usage Costs**:
- Streaming ingestion: $10K-$30K/year (10M profiles × 1 update/day × $0.10/1K)
- Profile storage: $20K-$50K/year (10M profiles at current rates)
- **Total AEP usage: $30K-$80K/year**

**GCP Costs**:
- BigQuery scoring queries: $2K-$10K/year
- Streaming service compute: $5K-$15K/year (running 24/7 to push updates)
- Egress: $1K-$3K/year
- **Total GCP: $8K-$28K/year**

**Implementation**:
- Initial setup: $40K-$80K (4-8 weeks for XDM schema, streaming pipeline, testing)
- Ongoing maintenance: 0.5-1 FTE (~$60K-$120K/year)

**Total First-Year Cost**: $248K-$858K

**Cost Comparison**: This is ~15-30% MORE expensive than Federated Audience Composition but provides real-time capabilities and full AEP feature access.

HYBRID BENEFITS:
✓ Best economics: $286K-$693K/year (20-30% less than full real-time)
✓ 95-99% data reduction (99% via federated, 1% via streaming)
✓ Real-time where it matters, batch where it's sufficient
✓ 99% vendor independence (bulk logic in BigQuery)
✓ Incremental adoption path (start federated, add real-time)

USE CASE SPLIT:
• 99% Batch: Daily nurture, weekly campaigns, suppression lists
• 1% Real-Time: Sales alerts, urgent lead routing, time-sensitive offers
```

### What It Is

This pattern combines the best of both approaches: use Federated Audience Composition for 99% of use cases (batch campaigns) and Computed Attributes for 1% of use cases (real-time alerts). You get the cost efficiency and vendor independence of FAC while maintaining real-time capabilities for critical workflows.

**Key Concept**: Not all audiences need real-time updates. Most marketing campaigns operate on daily/weekly schedules. Reserve expensive real-time profile updates for truly time-sensitive use cases.

**How It Works** (conceptually):
- **Batch Audiences (99%)**: Use Federated Audience Composition to query BigQuery daily/weekly for campaign audiences
  - "Hot leads for nurture campaign" (daily refresh is fine)
  - "Dormant customers for win-back email" (weekly refresh is fine)
  - "High-value prospects for sales outreach" (daily refresh is fine)

- **Real-Time Profiles (1%)**: Stream minimal computed attributes for urgent use cases
  - "Lead score jumped from 30 to 95" → Alert sales rep immediately
  - "Customer viewed pricing page 3x in 10 minutes" → Trigger immediate chatbot offer
  - "User abandoned cart with high-value items" → Send SMS within 5 minutes

**Data Transfer Volume**:
- Federated: 50-200 MB/year for audience IDs (99% of profiles)
- Computed: 50-100 MB/year for real-time subset (1% of profiles, more frequent updates)
- Total: <300 MB/year vs 2-10 TB for full ingestion

### Why This Option Makes Sense

**Strategic Advantages**:
1. **Best Economics**: Combines FAC cost efficiency for bulk with targeted real-time investment
2. **Right-Sized Capabilities**: Pay for real-time only where it delivers ROI
3. **Minimal Lock-in**: 99% of audiences remain portable in BigQuery
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces complexity vs full real-time ingestion

**Architectural Advantages**:
- Separates "batch analytics" from "real-time triggers" concerns
- Allows different SLAs for different audience types
- Provides incremental path: start with FAC, add real-time selectively
- Optimizes cost/performance trade-offs per use case

### Key Benefits

1. **Cost Optimization**: Pays for real-time only where needed
   - Federated audiences: $40K-$80K/year (handles 99% of volume)
   - Real-time profiles: $10K-$30K/year (handles 1% critical subset)
   - vs $80K-$145K/year for full real-time ingestion

2. **Flexibility**: Different latencies for different needs
   - Daily refresh for nurture campaigns (FAC)
   - Hourly refresh for operational reports (FAC)
   - <5 minute updates for sales alerts (Computed Attributes)

3. **Incremental Adoption**: Start simple, add complexity when justified
   - Phase 1: Deploy FAC for all audiences (2-4 weeks)
   - Phase 2: Identify 1-2 real-time use cases with clear ROI
   - Phase 3: Add streaming for those specific use cases (2-4 weeks)
   - Phase 4: Measure ROI, expand or contract real-time scope

4. **Risk Mitigation**: Limits vendor lock-in to small percentage
   - If you switch from AEP, lose only 1% real-time capability
   - Retain 99% of audience logic in BigQuery
   - Switching cost reduced by 90% vs full AEP dependency

### Key Limitations

**Operational Complexity**:
- **Dual architecture**: Must manage both FAC compositions AND streaming ingestion pipelines
- **Two skillsets**: Need BigQuery expertise AND AEP profile/segment expertise
- **Complexity overhead**: More moving parts than single-approach solutions

**Cost Considerations**:
- **Higher than FAC alone**: Adds 15-25% cost vs pure FAC approach
- **Lower savings than FAC**: Don't get full 50% cost reduction
- **Hybrid licensing**: May need higher AEP tier even with minimal profile counts

**Decision Fatigue**:
- **Per-use-case evaluation**: Every new audience requires "batch or real-time?" decision
- **Governance overhead**: Need clear criteria for when to use real-time vs batch
- **Team alignment**: Marketing/sales must understand latency trade-offs

### When to Use This Option

**Ideal For**:
- Organizations with BOTH batch campaign needs AND real-time trigger requirements
- Companies that identified specific high-ROI real-time use cases (e.g., sales alerts generating $500K/year)
- Enterprises wanting to minimize vendor lock-in while maintaining strategic real-time capabilities
- Teams comfortable managing architectural complexity for cost optimization

**NOT Suitable For**:
- Small teams without capacity to manage dual architecture
- Pure batch use cases (just use FAC)
- Pure real-time use cases (just use Computed Attributes)
- Organizations preferring architectural simplicity over cost optimization

### Rough Cost Estimate

**AEP Licensing**:
- Real-Time CDP (Foundation tier sufficient): $100K-$250K/year
- Journey Optimizer Prime: $50K-$150K/year
- Federated Audience Composition add-on: $40K-$80K/year
- **Total AEP: $190K-$480K/year**

**AEP Usage Costs** (for 1% real-time profiles):
- Streaming ingestion: $1K-$3K/year (100K profiles × 10 updates/day)
- Profile storage: $2K-$5K/year (100K profiles)
- **Total AEP usage: $3K-$8K/year**

**GCP Costs**:
- BigQuery for FAC queries: $5K-$15K/year
- BigQuery for real-time scoring: $2K-$8K/year
- Streaming service compute: $5K-$10K/year
- VPN connection: $1K-$2K/year
- **Total GCP: $13K-$35K/year**

**Implementation**:
- Initial FAC setup: $20K-$40K (2-4 weeks)
- Real-time pipeline setup: $20K-$40K (2-4 weeks)
- Ongoing maintenance: 0.5-0.75 FTE (~$60K-$90K/year)

**Total First-Year Cost**: $286K-$693K

**Cost Comparison**:
- 15-25% MORE than pure FAC (but gains real-time capabilities)
- 20-30% LESS than pure Computed Attributes (by limiting real-time to 1%)

## Option 4: External Audiences (CSV/API Upload)

### What It Is

External Audiences allow you to upload pre-built audience lists (customer IDs) from external systems into AEP via CSV files or API. You build audiences in BigQuery, export the customer IDs, and import them into AEP for activation to destinations.

**Source**: [External Audiences API Documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/api/external-audiences)

**Key Concept**: This is the SIMPLEST zero-copy approach - build everything in BigQuery, then upload just the final ID lists to AEP.

**How It Works** (conceptually):
- Run your lead scoring queries in BigQuery: `SELECT customer_id FROM leads WHERE classification = 'hot'`
- Export results to CSV or call AEP's `/external-audience` API endpoint with ID list
- AEP stores the IDs as an "External Audience"
- Activate this audience to destinations (Marketo, Google Ads, etc.)
- Manually re-upload when you want to refresh (or schedule via automation)

**Data Transfer Volume**: For 500K "hot leads", you transfer just 500K IDs (~10-50 MB per upload).

### Critical Distinction: External Audiences vs Federated Audience Composition

**These are NOT the same, despite similar naming**:

| Aspect | External Audiences (CSV/API) | Federated Audience Composition |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Data Movement** | IDs **COPIED** to AEP | Data **QUERIED** in BigQuery |
| **Refresh** | Manual re-upload required | Scheduled automatic queries |
| **TTL (Expiration)** | 1-90 days (default 30) | No expiration, always fresh |
| **AEP Configuration** | None (just API credentials) | Federated database connection setup |
| **Query Execution** | You run query in BigQuery | AEP runs query on your BigQuery |
| **Zero-Copy** | NO (IDs copied) | YES (true zero-copy) |

**Important**: Federated Audience Composition CREATES "external audiences" as metadata, but the underlying mechanism is fundamentally different (queries in-place vs copying data).

### Why This Option Makes Sense

**Strategic Advantages**:
1. **Simplest Implementation**: No AEP Federated setup, no streaming pipelines - just upload IDs
2. **No Ongoing Costs**: No query costs, no connection fees after initial setup
3. **Testing-Friendly**: Perfect for POCs or evaluating AEP before full commitment
4. **Flexible Tooling**: Use any BigQuery export method (bq command, Airflow, Cloud Scheduler)

**Operational Advantages**:
- No specialized AEP knowledge required
- Works with existing BigQuery export workflows
- Easy to understand and troubleshoot
- Can upload from local files for one-time campaigns

### Key Benefits

1. **Fastest POC**: Can be running in <1 week
   - Export BigQuery results to CSV
   - Upload to AEP via UI or API
   - Configure destination and activate
   - No infrastructure setup

2. **Zero AEP Configuration**: Just need API credentials
   - No federated database connection
   - No XDM schemas for source data
   - No streaming pipeline development

3. **Audit Trail**: Full control over what gets uploaded
   - Review CSV before upload
   - Test with subset of IDs first
   - Clear timestamps of each upload

### Key Limitations

**CRITICAL DOWNSIDES - This is NOT a long-term solution**:

1. **Data IS Copied (NOT Zero-Copy)**:
   - Despite the name "External Audiences", data **IS copied into AEP**
   - IDs stored in both Profile Store and Data Lake
   - Subject to AEP profile storage costs if large volumes

2. **TTL Expiration (30-90 days)**:
   - Audiences **automatically expire** after TTL period
   - Default: 30 days
   - Must re-upload to refresh (manual process)
   - **No auto-refresh capability** unlike Federated

3. **Manual Refresh Required**:
   - Every update requires new CSV/API call
   - Must build automation if you want scheduled refreshes
   - More operational overhead than Federated (which auto-refreshes)

4. **File Size Constraints**:
   - CSV max: <1GB file size
   - CSV max: 25 columns
   - Large audiences may require splitting into multiple files

5. **Static Lists Only**:
   - No dynamic re-evaluation of rules
   - If lead classification changes in BigQuery, must re-upload entire audience
   - Cannot combine with profile-based segmentation rules in AEP

**Source**: [External Audiences Specifications](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/api/external-audiences)

### When to Use This Option

**Ideal For**:
- **POC/Testing**: Evaluating AEP before committing to Federated or Computed Attributes setup
- **One-Time Campaigns**: Holiday promotions, product launches, event attendees
- **Small Audiences**: <100K profiles, infrequent updates (monthly or less)
- **Suppression Lists**: "Do not contact", "already converted" lists that change rarely
- **Quick Wins**: Need activation running THIS WEEK, can migrate to better approach later

**NOT Suitable For**:
- **Daily/Weekly Campaigns**: Manual refresh is too operationally expensive
- **Large Audiences**: >1M profiles hit file size limits, multiple uploads required
- **Dynamic Segmentation**: Needs real-time or frequent re-evaluation of criteria
- **Long-Term Production Use**: Federated Audience Composition is better in every way for ongoing use

### Honest Assessment: When to Choose This

**Choose External Audiences IF**:
- You need to test AEP activation capabilities with minimal setup
- You have a specific one-time campaign and no future AEP plans
- You're evaluating AEP vs competitors and want quick comparison

**DO NOT choose External Audiences IF**:
- You have ongoing, recurring audience activation needs → Use **Federated Audience Composition** instead
- You need real-time updates → Use **Computed Attributes** instead
- You value operational efficiency → Manual refresh is unsustainable at scale

### Migration Path

**Recommended: Start here, migrate to Federated**:

```
Week 1-2:   Upload audiences via External Audiences API/CSV (TEST AEP)
Week 3-4:   Evaluate activation results, test destinations
Week 5-6:   Migrate to Federated Audience Composition (PRODUCTION)
```

**Why this works**:
- Proves AEP activation works for your use case
- Minimal investment before commitment
- Easy migration: same audience IDs, just change source from manual upload → federated query

### Rough Cost Estimate

**AEP Licensing** (if activating via destinations):
- Real-Time CDP (Foundation tier sufficient): $100K-$250K/year
- **Total AEP: $100K-$250K/year**

**AEP Usage Costs**:
- API calls for uploads: Negligible (<$100/year for typical usage)
- Profile storage: $0-$10K/year (depends on whether AEP treats external audience IDs as profiles)
- **Total AEP usage: <$10K/year**

**GCP Costs**:
- BigQuery query costs: $500-$2K/year (ad-hoc queries, not scheduled like FAC)
- Export/egress: <$50/year
- **Total GCP: $500-$2K/year**

**Implementation**:
- Initial setup: $5K-$15K (1 week consulting to build upload automation)
- Ongoing maintenance: 0.1-0.25 FTE (~$12K-$30K/year for monthly re-uploads)

**Total First-Year Cost**: $112K-$292K

**Cost Comparison**:
- **55-60% LOWER** than Federated Audience Composition licensing ($100K-$250K vs $190K-$530K)
- **BUT**: Higher operational overhead (manual refresh)
- **NOTE**: If you're already paying for RT-CDP, incremental cost is near-zero

### Simple Decision Tree

**START HERE**: What is your MOST CRITICAL requirement?

**Question 1: Do you need real-time activation with <5 minute latency?**

- **No** → Go to Question 2
- **Yes** → Go to Question 3

**Question 2: Is this a purely batch use case? (daily/weekly campaigns)**

- **Yes, batch only**:
  - Is vendor lock-in a concern?
    - **High concern** → **Choose Federated Audience Composition** (Option 1)
    - **Low concern** → **Choose Federated Audience Composition** (Option 1) - still the best economics

- **No, we might need real-time later**:
  - Can you delay real-time for 6-12 months?
    - **Yes** → **Choose Federated Audience Composition** (Option 1) - add real-time later if needed
    - **No** → **Choose Hybrid Selective** (Option 3) - plan for phased rollout

**Question 3: Real-time is required. What percentage of your use cases need <5 minute latency?**

- **Less than 10%** → **Choose Hybrid Selective** (Option 3)
- **More than 50%** → **Choose Computed Attributes** (Option 2)
- **10-50%** → Go to Question 4

**Question 4: Are you willing to trade cost savings for architectural simplicity?**

- **Simplicity preferred** → **Choose Computed Attributes** (Option 2) - single architecture
- **Cost optimization preferred** → **Choose Hybrid Selective** (Option 3) - manage complexity

**Question 5: Do you need Adobe's Customer AI or Attribution AI?**

- **Yes** → **Cannot use pure Federated Audience Composition** - Choose Option 2 or 3
- **No** → **Federated Audience Composition** (Option 1) remains best choice for batch use cases

---

### If You Choose Option 2: Computed Attributes Pattern

**Immediate Actions** (Week 1-2):

1. **XDM Schema Design**:
   - Document your computed attributes (lead_classification, propensity_score, etc.)
   - Design minimal XDM schema with ONLY derived fields (5-10 fields, not 100+)
   - Define data types, enumerations, validation rules
   - Plan for schema evolution (how to add fields later)

2. **Identity Strategy**:
   - Determine primary identity namespace (email, CRM ID, custom?)
   - Plan for identity mapping (how BigQuery IDs map to AEP identities)
   - Review AEP Identity Graph requirements if cross-device stitching needed

3. **Streaming Pipeline Architecture**:
   - Choose implementation approach:
     - Cloud Function triggered by BigQuery scheduled query
     - Cloud Run service polling BigQuery for changes
     - Pub/Sub + Dataflow for high-volume streaming
   - Design error handling and retry logic
   - Plan for monitoring and alerting

4. **AEP Sandbox Setup**:
   - Create development sandbox for testing
   - Configure data collection (schema, dataset, datastream)
   - Generate API credentials for streaming ingestion
   - Test with sample payload

**Implementation Phase** (Week 3-8):

5. **Schema Creation**:
   - Create XDM schema in AEP UI
   - Enable for Profile and configure merge policy
   - Create dataset linked to schema
   - Validate with test records

6. **Streaming Service Development**:
   - Implement service that reads BigQuery scoring results
   - Build AEP API client (streaming ingestion endpoint)
   - Add batching logic (collect 100-1000 profiles, send as batch)
   - Implement exponential backoff for API rate limits
   - Add structured logging for observability

7. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for transformation logic
   - Integration tests against AEP dev sandbox
   - Load testing (can you handle 10M profile updates/day?)
   - Error scenario testing (API failures, network issues)

8. **Segmentation Setup**:
   - Create test segments based on computed attributes
   - Validate segment counts match expected values
   - Configure streaming vs batch evaluation based on latency needs
   - Test segment membership updates as profiles change

9. **Production Deployment**:
   - Deploy streaming service to Cloud Run / Cloud Functions
   - Configure production AEP credentials
   - Gradual rollout: 1% → 10% → 50% → 100% of profiles
   - Monitor ingestion success rates and latency

**Ongoing Operations**:
- Monitor streaming ingestion metrics in AEP UI
- Track BigQuery → AEP latency (should be <5 minutes)
- Review API costs and optimize batch sizes
- Manage schema evolution (adding new computed attributes)

---

### If You Choose Option 3: Hybrid Selective Pattern

**Immediate Actions** (Week 1-2):

1. **Use Case Classification**:
   - Audit all current and planned audience use cases
   - Categorize by latency requirement:
     - **Batch**: Can tolerate 1-24 hour refresh (daily campaigns)
     - **Real-time**: Requires <5 minute latency (sales alerts)
   - Quantify: What % of profiles need real-time? (Target: <10%)
   - Document ROI for real-time use cases (e.g., "sales alerts drive $500K/year revenue")

2. **Architecture Decision**:
   - Decide on phasing:
     - **Option A**: Deploy FAC first (weeks 1-4), add real-time later (weeks 5-12)
     - **Option B**: Deploy both in parallel (weeks 1-12, higher risk)
   - Recommendation: Choose Option A for lower risk

3. **Team Alignment**:
   - Establish governance: Who decides if a new use case gets real-time treatment?
   - Define criteria: Real-time only if demonstrable ROI or <5min latency requirement
   - Create decision template for stakeholders

**Implementation Phase 1: Federated Audiences** (Week 3-6):

4. **Follow "Option 1: Federated Audience Composition" Next Steps** for batch audiences:
   - BigQuery dataset setup
   - AEP FAC configuration
   - Composition creation for 80-90% of use cases
   - Destination activation

**Implementation Phase 2: Real-Time Subset** (Week 7-12):

5. **Follow "Option 2: Computed Attributes" Next Steps** for real-time subset:
   - XDM schema for computed attributes (ONLY for real-time use cases)
   - Streaming pipeline for <10% of profiles requiring real-time
   - Segment creation for real-time triggers

6. **Hybrid Orchestration**:
   - Document which audiences use FAC vs streaming
   - Create runbooks for each path
   - Train team on when to use which approach

**Ongoing Operations**:
- Monthly review: Are real-time use cases delivering ROI?
- Quarterly assessment: Should more use cases move to real-time? Or fewer?
- Cost tracking: Monitor FAC vs streaming costs separately
- Optimization: Can any real-time use cases be downgraded to batch?

1. **BigQuery Support Verification** (2025):
   - "What is the current state of BigQuery support in Federated Audience Composition as of October 2025?"
   - "Are there any known limitations or performance issues specific to BigQuery vs other warehouses?"
   - "What BigQuery features are NOT supported (e.g., nested/repeated fields, certain functions)?"

2. **Licensing & Costs**:
   - "What is the exact pricing for the Federated Audience Composition add-on SKU?"
   - "Are there additional costs based on query volume, data volume, or audience count?"
   - "What tier of RT-CDP and Journey Optimizer is required? Can we use Foundation tier?"

3. **Data Volume & Performance Guardrails**:
   - "What are the maximum limits for federated audience composition?"
     - Maximum BigQuery query execution time before timeout?
     - Maximum audience size (number of IDs returned)?
     - Maximum number of compositions per sandbox?
     - Maximum refresh frequency (can we go hourly? sub-hourly?)?
   - "What happens if a composition query exceeds limits - does it fail gracefully?"

4. **Operational Capabilities**:
   - "You mentioned audiences cannot be deleted in the current version. When will this be fixed?"
   - "Can we programmatically create/update compositions via API, or only through UI?"
   - "What monitoring and alerting capabilities exist for composition failures?"

5. **Security & Compliance**:
   - "What data encryption is used for queries in transit and at rest?"
   - "Can we use VPC Service Controls or Private Service Connect instead of IP allowlisting?"
   - "How do we audit AEP's access to our BigQuery data?"

### External Audiences Questions

6. **External Audiences vs Federated Audience Composition**:
   - "Can you clarify the relationship between 'External Audiences' and 'Federated Audience Composition'?"
   - "Are there use cases where we should use the External Audiences API/CSV upload instead of FAC?"
   - "What happens to audiences after the 30-day TTL - are they automatically refreshed or deleted?"

7. **Migration & Integration**:
   - "If we start with Federated Audience Composition, can we later add streaming profile ingestion for a subset?"
   - "Can federated audiences be combined with profile-based segments in the UI?"
   - "What destinations support federated audiences vs requiring full profiles?"

### Cost Optimization Questions

8. **Cost Transparency**:
   - "Can you provide a detailed cost breakdown for our specific scenario: 10M profiles, 20-50 daily audiences, BigQuery source?"
   - "What are the hidden costs we should be aware of (API calls, destination activations, etc.)?"
   - "Are there cost differences between different destination types (batch file vs API vs streaming)?"
