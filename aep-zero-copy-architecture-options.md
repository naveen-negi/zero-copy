# AEP Zero-Copy Architecture: Analysis & Recommendations

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line Up Front**: True "zero-copy" is fundamentally incompatible with Adobe Experience Platform's architecture. AEP requires customer profile data to reside within its platform to power Real-Time CDP, segmentation, and journey orchestration capabilities. However, we can achieve **data minimization** through strategic architectural patterns that reduce data transfer by 60-85% compared to naive implementations.

**Key Finding**: For your Cold/Warm/Hot lead classification use case, the optimal approach is **computed scores in GCP + minimal profile attributes in AEP**, not full data replication.

**Important Update on Federated Queries**: AEP does NOT support federated queries to external data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.). Unlike modern data platforms that can query data in-place, AEP requires data ingestion before it can be used for segmentation or activation. See Section 2.5 for detailed analysis of why this limitation exists and what alternatives are available.

---

## 1. Understanding AEP's Architectural Constraints

### 1.1 Why True Zero-Copy Fails with AEP

AEP's core value proposition creates fundamental barriers to zero-copy architecture:

1. **Real-Time Customer Profile Storage Requirement**
   - AEP must store profile data in its proprietary Profile Store to enable sub-second lookup
   - Identity graph construction requires data residency within AEP
   - Merge policies operate on stored data, not external references

2. **Segmentation Engine Dependencies**
   - Streaming segmentation evaluates against in-platform profile attributes
   - Batch segmentation queries the Profile Store directly via Query Service
   - Edge segmentation requires profile projection to Edge nodes

3. **No External Data Federation**
   - AEP cannot query external data sources (like BigQuery) during segment evaluation
   - No support for "virtual profiles" that reference external systems
   - Query Service only accesses AEP's Data Lake, not external databases

**Technical Reality**: AEP is designed as a centralized customer data platform, not a federated query engine like Google BigQuery or Snowflake.

### 1.2 What "Minimized Data Transfer" Actually Means

Given AEP's constraints, we redefine the goal:

- **Not Zero-Copy**: Eliminating all data transfer to AEP
- **But Data Minimization**: Transferring only essential attributes required for segmentation and activation
- **Target Reduction**: 60-85% less data vs. naive full-profile replication

---

## 2. Data Minimization Patterns for AEP

### 2.1 Pattern 1: Computed Attributes from GCP (RECOMMENDED for Lead Scoring)

**Concept**: Perform heavy computation in GCP, send only derived scores/classifications to AEP.

#### Architecture
```
GCP BigQuery (Source of Truth)
    |
    | 1. Run ML models, aggregations, complex joins
    V
Computed Attributes:
  - lead_classification: "cold" | "warm" | "hot"
  - propensity_score: 0.0 - 1.0
  - engagement_index: integer
  - last_interaction_date: timestamp
  - primary_product_interest: enum
    |
    | 2. Stream ONLY derived attributes via HTTP API
    V
AEP Real-Time Customer Profile
  - Minimal schema (5-10 fields vs 100+ raw fields)
  - Profiles updated via Streaming Ingestion API
    |
    | 3. Segment on computed attributes
    V
Segment: "Hot Leads" WHERE lead_classification = "hot"
    |
    | 4. Activate to destinations
    V
Marketo, Google Ads, Email ESP
```

#### Implementation Details

**XDM Schema Design** (Minimal Profile):
```json
{
  "title": "Minimal Lead Profile",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Primary identifier"
    },
    "identityMap": {
      "email": [{"id": "user@example.com"}],
      "gcpCustomerId": [{"id": "gcp-12345"}]
    },
    "leadClassification": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["cold", "warm", "hot"],
      "meta:usereditable": false
    },
    "propensityScore": {
      "type": "number",
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 1
    },
    "engagementIndex": {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "Pre-computed from GCP"
    },
    "lastInteractionTimestamp": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time"
    },
    "primaryProductInterest": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["savings", "credit", "investment", "mortgage"]
    },
    "relationshipManagerId": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

**Data Transfer Comparison**:
- **Full Profile Replication**: 50-200 KB per profile (behavioral events, transaction history, demographic data)
- **Computed Attributes Only**: 1-3 KB per profile (5-10 fields)
- **Reduction**: 95-98% less data per profile

**GCP to AEP Streaming Ingestion** (Python Example):

            }
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(
        AEP_STREAMING_ENDPOINT,

    return response

# Usage in Cloud Function or Dataflow pipeline
def process_customer(customer_id, email):
    # 1. Compute in GCP (heavy lifting)
    customer_data = {'id': customer_id, 'email': email}
    computed = compute_lead_classification(customer_data)

    # 2. Stream only results to AEP (minimal data)
    stream_to_aep(customer_id, email, computed)
```

**When to Update AEP**:
- **Real-time triggers**: When lead classification changes (cold -> warm -> hot)
- **Batch refresh**: Daily updates for engagement_index and propensity_score
- **Event-driven**: After significant interactions (webinar attendance, product inquiry)

**Pros**:
- **Minimal data transfer**: Only derived attributes, not raw events
- **Computation scalability**: Leverage GCP's compute (BigQuery, Dataflow, Vertex AI)
- **Flexibility**: Change scoring logic in GCP without AEP schema changes
- **Cost efficiency**: Avoid AEP Query Service costs for complex computations
- **Reduced vendor lock-in**: Business logic stays in GCP, not AEP

**Cons**:
- **Latency**: Scores computed in GCP, then streamed to AEP (adds 5-30 seconds)
- **Dual system complexity**: Maintain scoring pipelines in GCP and profiles in AEP
- **Limited AEP AI**: Can't use Customer AI (requires raw behavioral data in AEP)
- **Segment expressiveness**: Can only segment on computed attributes, not raw events

**Cost Implications**:
- **AEP Licensing**: Profile count-based. Minimal schema doesn't reduce profile count, but reduces storage costs.
- **AEP API**: Streaming Ingestion charged per API call. Batch updates (daily) cheaper than real-time.
- **GCP Compute**: BigQuery ML, Dataflow costs for scoring pipelines.

**Best Fit**:
- **Your use case**: Cold/Warm/Hot lead classification with complex scoring logic
- Organizations with existing ML/data science capabilities in GCP/Databricks/Snowflake
- Use cases where scoring logic changes frequently
- Scenarios requiring explainability (scoring logic in SQL, not AEP black box)

---

### 2.2 Pattern 2: Reference Architecture with External Profile Store

**Concept**: Store full profiles in GCP, send only identifiers + minimal attributes to AEP for activation.

#### Architecture
```
GCP BigQuery (Master Profile Store)
  - Full customer profiles (100+ attributes)
  - Transaction history
  - Behavioral events
    |
    | NO bulk data transfer
    V
AEP Real-Time Customer Profile
  - Profile stub: ID + 3-5 key attributes for segmentation
  - Example: email, lead_status, product_interest
    |
    | Segment in AEP (limited criteria)
    V
Segment Qualified: customer_id list
    |
    | 1. Export segment membership via Destinations API
    V
GCP Cloud Function
    |
    | 2. Enrich with full profile from BigQuery
    V
Destination (Marketo, Google Ads)
  - Activated with full profile data
```

#### Implementation Details

**AEP Profile Stub Schema**:
```json
{
  "title": "Profile Reference Stub",
  "properties": {
    "_id": {"type": "string"},
    "identityMap": {
      "email": [{"id": "user@example.com"}],
      "gcpProfileId": [{"id": "bq-profile-12345"}]
    },
    "segmentationFlags": {
      "isHighValue": {"type": "boolean"},
      "productInterest": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

**Enrichment Function** (GCP Cloud Function):
```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
import requests

def aep_segment_webhook(request):
    """
    Webhook triggered by AEP when segment membership changes.
    Enriches profile IDs with full data from BigQuery.
    """
    segment_payload = request.get_json()
    profile_ids = segment_payload.get('profiles', [])

    # Fetch full profiles from BigQuery
    bq_client = bigquery.Client()
    query = f"""
    SELECT *
    FROM `project.dataset.customer_profiles`
    WHERE customer_id IN UNNEST(@profile_ids)
    """
    job_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(
        query_parameters=[
            bigquery.ArrayQueryParameter("profile_ids", "STRING", profile_ids)
        ]
    )
    results = bq_client.query(query, job_config=job_config).result()

    # Activate enriched profiles to destination
    for row in results:
        activate_to_marketo(row)

    return {'status': 'success', 'processed': len(profile_ids)}

def activate_to_marketo(profile_data):
    # Send full profile to Marketo API
    marketo_payload = {
        'email': profile_data['email'],
        'firstName': profile_data['first_name'],
        'lastName': profile_data['last_name'],
        'customField1': profile_data['custom_field_1'],
        # ... all other fields from BigQuery
    }
    requests.post('https://marketo.com/rest/v1/leads.json', json=marketo_payload)
```

**Data Transfer**:
- **AEP Ingestion**: ~500 bytes per profile (ID + 2-3 flags)
- **Segment Export**: Only profile IDs (50-100 bytes per profile)
- **Enrichment**: Full profiles fetched from GCP only for qualified segment members

**Pros**:
- **Minimal AEP storage**: Only profile stubs, not full profiles
- **Data sovereignty**: Full profiles stay in GCP (GDPR, CCPA compliance easier)
- **Flexible enrichment**: Add new attributes without AEP schema changes
- **Cost optimization**: Avoid AEP storage costs for large attribute sets

**Cons**:
- **Segmentation limitations**: Can only segment on stub attributes in AEP
- **Latency**: Enrichment adds delay (5-30 seconds)
- **Complex architecture**: Requires external orchestration (Cloud Functions, webhooks)
- **AEP value dilution**: Not using AEP's profile management capabilities
- **Activation limitations**: Can't use AEP's native destination connectors with full profile data

**Cost Implications**:
- **Reduced AEP storage**: Lower data lake storage costs
- **Increased GCP costs**: BigQuery queries for enrichment
- **Operational overhead**: Maintain enrichment pipelines

**Honest Assessment**: This pattern undermines AEP's core value. If you're only using AEP for segment membership lists, consider:
- **Alternative 1**: Use GCP-native tools (BigQuery + Cloud Composer) for segmentation
- **Alternative 2**: Use a lighter CDP (Segment, mParticle) that's designed for data routing, not storage
- **Alternative 3**: Direct integrations from GCP to destinations (Google Ads, Marketo APIs)

**When This Makes Sense**:
- You're contractually obligated to use AEP but want to minimize vendor lock-in
- You need AEP's specific destination connectors but can't store full profiles in AEP (data residency requirements)
- You're evaluating AEP and want to pilot with minimal data commitment

---

### 2.3 Pattern 3: Event-Driven Architecture with Minimal Profile State

**Concept**: Stream events to AEP for real-time segmentation, but keep profile state minimal.

#### Architecture
```
GCP Pub/Sub (Event Stream)
  - Page views, clicks, transactions (ephemeral)
    |
    | Stream events via AEP Streaming API
    V
AEP Experience Events (Time-Series Data)
  - Stored for 30-90 days (configurable)
  - NOT merged into profile (unless explicitly configured)
    |
    | Real-time segmentation on recent events
    V
Segment: "Viewed product page in last 24 hours"
    |
    V
Activation to Google Ads for retargeting
```

**Key Principle**: Use AEP as a **stateless event processor**, not a profile store.

#### Implementation

**Event Schema** (XDM ExperienceEvent):
```json
{
  "title": "Minimal Experience Event",
  "allOf": [
    {"$ref": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/context/experienceevent"}
  ],
  "properties": {
    "_id": {"type": "string"},
    "timestamp": {"type": "string", "format": "date-time"},
    "eventType": {"type": "string"},
    "identityMap": {
      "email": [{"id": "user@example.com"}]
    },
    "web": {
      "webPageDetails": {
        "URL": {"type": "string"},
        "name": {"type": "string"}
      }
    },
    "productListItems": [
      {
        "SKU": {"type": "string"},
        "name": {"type": "string"}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Streaming Events from GCP**:
```python
import json
import requests
from google.cloud import pubsub_v1

def pubsub_to_aep(event, context):
    """
    Cloud Function triggered by Pub/Sub.
    Streams event to AEP without creating persistent profile.
    """
    pubsub_message = json.loads(base64.b64decode(event['data']).decode('utf-8'))

    aep_payload = {
        "header": {
            "schemaRef": {
                "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT}/schemas/{EVENT_SCHEMA_ID}",
                "contentType": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1"
            },
            "imsOrgId": "{IMS_ORG_ID}",
            "datasetId": "{EVENT_DATASET_ID}"
        },
        "body": {
            "xdmMeta": {
                "schemaRef": {
                    "id": "https://ns.adobe.com/{TENANT}/schemas/{EVENT_SCHEMA_ID}",
                    "contentType": "application/vnd.adobe.xed-full+json;version=1"
                }
            },
            "xdmEntity": {
                "_id": pubsub_message['event_id'],
                "timestamp": pubsub_message['timestamp'],
                "eventType": pubsub_message['event_type'],
                "identityMap": {
                    "email": [{"id": pubsub_message['email']}]
                },
                "web": {
                    "webPageDetails": {
                        "URL": pubsub_message['page_url']
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(
        f"https://dcs.adobedc.net/collection/{DATASET_ID}",
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        data=json.dumps(aep_payload)
    )
    return response.status_code
```

**Profile Configuration** (Disable Profile for Events):
- In AEP UI, disable "Profile" toggle for the ExperienceEvent dataset
- Events stored in Data Lake, NOT merged into Real-Time Customer Profile
- Use Query Service for historical analysis, not Profile Store

**Segmentation Approach**:
- **Streaming segments on events**: "Viewed product X in last 24 hours"
- **No persistent profile attributes**: Segment membership based on recent events only
- **TTL-based**: Segments automatically expire (e.g., 24-hour window)

**Pros**:
- **True ephemeral data**: Events auto-delete after retention period (30-90 days)
- **Minimal storage**: No profile accumulation
- **Real-time segmentation**: Leverage AEP's streaming segment engine
- **GDPR-friendly**: Data naturally expires

**Cons**:
- **Limited segmentation**: Can't segment on "lifetime value" or historical patterns
- **No identity stitching**: Can't resolve cross-device identities without profile
- **Loses AEP's core value**: Not using Real-Time Customer Profile
- **Query Service costs**: If you need historical analysis, Query Service charges apply

**When This Makes Sense**:
- **Retargeting use cases**: "Viewed product but didn't purchase in last 24 hours"
- **Real-time triggers**: Abandoned cart recovery, browse abandonment
- **Privacy-first**: Minimize data retention
- **Pilot projects**: Test AEP's streaming capabilities without full commitment

**Honest Assessment**: If you're only using events without profiles, AEP is overkill. Consider:
- **Google Analytics 4 + BigQuery**: Native GCP integration, similar event streaming
- **Segment**: Better suited for event routing without profile storage
- **GCP Pub/Sub + Dataflow**: Build custom real-time segmentation logic

### 2.4 Pattern 4: Hybrid Batch + Streaming with Selective Profile Updates

**Concept**: Stream high-priority events in real-time, batch-update computed attributes daily.

#### Architecture
```
GCP Ecosystem:
  |
  +-- Real-time Events (Pub/Sub) ---> AEP Streaming API
  |     - Cart abandonment             (Latency: <5 seconds)
  |     - Product inquiries
  |
  +-- Batch Computation (Dataflow) --> AEP Batch Ingestion API
        - Daily lead score refresh     (Latency: daily)
        - Monthly lifetime value
        - Weekly engagement index
```

**XDM Schema** (Hybrid Profile):
```json
{
  "title": "Hybrid Lead Profile",
  "properties": {
    "_id": {"type": "string"},
    "identityMap": {...},

    "realtimeAttributes": {
      "lastPageView": {"type": "string", "format": "date-time"},
      "currentSessionProductInterest": {"type": "string"}
    },

    "batchComputedAttributes": {
      "leadClassification": {"type": "string", "enum": ["cold", "warm", "hot"]},
      "propensityScore": {"type": "number"},
      "lifetimeValue": {"type": "number"},
      "engagementIndex": {"type": "integer"}
    }
  }
}
```

**Implementation**:

**Real-time Events** (Python Cloud Function):
```python
def stream_critical_event(event_data):
    """
    Stream only business-critical events that require immediate action.
    """
    critical_events = ['cart_abandoned', 'product_inquiry', 'callback_requested']

    if event_data['event_type'] in critical_events:
        # Stream to AEP for real-time segmentation
        stream_to_aep_api(event_data)
    else:
        # Log to BigQuery for batch processing
        log_to_bigquery(event_data)
```

**Batch Updates** (Daily via Dataflow):
```python
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions

def batch_update_aep_profiles():
    """
    Daily batch job to update computed lead scores.
    """
    pipeline_options = PipelineOptions(
        runner='DataflowRunner',
        project='your-gcp-project',
        region='us-central1'
    )

    with beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options) as pipeline:
        (pipeline
         | 'Read from BigQuery' >> beam.io.ReadFromBigQuery(
             query='''
                 SELECT
                   customer_id,
                   email,
                   computed_lead_classification,
                   propensity_score,
                   engagement_index
                 FROM `project.dataset.daily_lead_scores`
                 WHERE score_date = CURRENT_DATE()
             ''',
             use_standard_sql=True)
         | 'Transform to AEP format' >> beam.Map(transform_to_aep_batch_format)
         | 'Write to AEP Batch API' >> beam.ParDo(AEPBatchWriter())
        )

class AEPBatchWriter(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        # AEP Batch Ingestion API
        # Upload to GCS -> Register batch with AEP -> AEP ingests from GCS
        # See: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/ingestion/batch/api-overview.html
        pass
```

**Update Frequency Decision Matrix**:

| Attribute | Update Frequency | Method | Justification |
|-----------|------------------|--------|---------------|
| Lead Classification | Daily | Batch | Score stability, cost optimization |
| Cart Abandonment | Real-time | Streaming | Immediate action required (recovery email) |
| Propensity Score | Daily | Batch | ML model re-run nightly |
| Product Interest | Real-time | Streaming | Informs current session personalization |
| Lifetime Value | Weekly | Batch | Changes slowly, expensive to compute |
| Email Engagement | Batch (daily) | Batch | ESP webhook batching |

**Pros**:
- **Cost-optimized**: Batch for low-priority, streaming for high-priority
- **Latency balanced**: Real-time where needed, batch where acceptable
- **Reduced API calls**: Batch ingestion 100x cheaper than per-event streaming
- **Selective updates**: Only changed profiles in batch uploads

**Cons**:
- **Complexity**: Maintain both streaming and batch pipelines
- **Consistency challenges**: Real-time and batch attributes may conflict
- **Operational overhead**: Monitor two ingestion paths

**Cost Implications**:
- **AEP Batch Ingestion**: Flat rate per batch file (not per record)
- **AEP Streaming Ingestion**: Per API call (expensive at scale)
- **Rule of Thumb**: Batch is 100-1000x cheaper than streaming for bulk updates

### 2.5 Pattern 5: Federated Queries - Why AEP Doesn't Support Them

**User Question**: Why didn't you consider federated queries where AEP directly connects to data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake) as a zero-copy option?

#### 2.5.1 The Short Answer: AEP Does Not Support Federated Queries

**Critical Limitation**: As of January 2025, Adobe Experience Platform does NOT support federated queries to external data warehouses. This is a fundamental architectural constraint that differentiates AEP from modern data platforms like Snowflake, Databricks, or Google BigQuery.

**What This Means**:
- AEP cannot query data in BigQuery directly during segment evaluation
- AEP cannot create "virtual profiles" that reference external database records
- AEP Query Service only queries the AEP Data Lake, not external data sources
- All data used for segmentation and activation MUST be ingested into AEP first

**Contrast with True Federated Query Systems**:

| Platform | Federated Query Support | Example |
|----------|------------------------|---------|
| **Snowflake** | Yes (External Tables) | Query S3/GCS data without copying via Snowflake External Tables |
| **Google BigQuery** | Yes (External Tables, BigLake) | Query GCS, Drive, Cloud Storage without ingestion via external tables |
| **Databricks** | Yes (Delta Sharing) | Query remote Delta Lake tables without data movement |
| **Trino/Presto** | Yes (Connectors) | Query MySQL, PostgreSQL, S3 simultaneously in one query |
| **Adobe AEP** | **NO** | Must ingest all data before querying |

#### 2.5.2 Technical Reasons Why AEP Cannot Support Federated Queries

**Architectural Constraint 1: Real-Time Customer Profile Store**

AEP's Real-Time Customer Profile is designed for sub-second lookup performance:

```
User Request: "Show me this customer's profile"
AEP Response Time: <100ms (profile lookup)

How it achieves this:
- Proprietary in-memory profile store (not standard SQL database)
- Pre-computed profile fragments stored on SSD
- Distributed hash-based lookup (not table scans)
```

**Why Federated Queries Would Break This**:
- BigQuery query latency: 1-30 seconds (even for indexed queries)
- External database queries require network round-trips (50-200ms minimum)
- Profile lookups would degrade from <100ms to 1-30 seconds
- AEP's personalization use case (real-time web/app personalization) requires <100ms

**Architectural Constraint 2: Segmentation Engine Design**

AEP's segmentation operates on pre-processed, indexed profile data:

```
Streaming Segmentation:
- Evaluates profile attributes against segment rules in <1 second
- Uses in-memory indexes for fast attribute lookup
- Cannot wait for external database queries (would violate latency SLA)

Batch Segmentation:
- Scans millions of profiles against complex segment rules
- Uses distributed processing across AEP cluster nodes
- Pre-computes attribute indexes (bloom filters, bitmaps)
- External queries would require scanning remote databases (prohibitively slow)
```

**Performance Math**:
```
Scenario: Evaluate segment "Hot Leads" (leadClassification = 'hot') for 10M profiles

AEP (Current Architecture):
- Data Location: AEP Profile Store (local SSD)
- Index: Pre-built bitmap index on leadClassification
- Evaluation Time: 5-30 minutes (batch job)
- Method: Parallel scan across AEP cluster nodes

Hypothetical Federated Query (if AEP supported it):
- Data Location: BigQuery (external, network latency)
- Query: SELECT customer_id FROM profiles WHERE leadClassification = 'hot'
- Network latency: 50-200ms per query batch
- BigQuery execution: 10-60 seconds
- Total Time: 10-60 seconds (seems faster!)

BUT: This breaks for complex segments:
- Segment: "Hot leads who viewed product X in last 7 days AND have LTV > $10K"
- Requires joining Profile data + ExperienceEvent data (time-series)
- AEP's time-series indexes: optimized for this query pattern
- Federated query: Would require joining BigQuery tables + AEP events (slow)
```

**Architectural Constraint 3: Identity Graph**

AEP's identity resolution requires all identity data to be stored within AEP:

```
Identity Graph Construction:
1. Ingest profile with identityMap: {email: "user@example.com", cookie: "abc123"}
2. Link identities in proprietary graph database (not SQL)
3. Merge profiles based on shared identities (instant lookup via graph traversal)

Why Federated Queries Don't Work:
- Identity graphs use specialized graph databases (not relational)
- Graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS) require low-latency local access
- Remote queries to BigQuery cannot provide <100ms identity lookups
- Merging profiles across external databases = prohibitively expensive joins
```

**Architectural Constraint 4: Data Model Differences**

AEP uses XDM (Experience Data Model), not standard SQL schemas:

```
XDM Profile Structure (hierarchical, nested):
{
  "identityMap": {...},
  "person": {
    "name": {...}
  },
  "_{TENANT}": {
    "customFields": {...}
  }
}

BigQuery Schema (flat or nested, but not XDM-compliant):
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  customer_id STRING,
  email STRING,
  first_name STRING,
  -- No native XDM structure
)
```

**Impedance Mismatch**:
- AEP segments written in PQL (Profile Query Language) expect XDM structure
- BigQuery uses SQL with different schema
- Translating PQL to SQL on arbitrary BigQuery schemas = unsolvable problem (would require custom mapping for every customer)
- Even if Adobe built SQL translation, customer BigQuery schemas don't match XDM (different field names, nesting, data types)

#### 2.5.3 What AEP Query Service Actually Does

**AEP Query Service** is often confused with federated queries, but it's NOT:

**What Query Service IS**:
```
AEP Query Service = SQL interface to AEP's Data Lake (already ingested data)

Architecture:
  AEP Data Lake (Azure Data Lake Storage)
    - Stores ingested datasets (Profile, ExperienceEvent)
    - Parquet files organized by dataset
    |
    V
  Query Service (PostgreSQL-compatible SQL engine)
    - Queries Parquet files in Data Lake
    - Used for analytics, data exploration, segment export
    - Timeout: 10 minutes per query

Use Cases:
- Ad-hoc data analysis (explore profiles, events)
- Export segment membership to GCS/S3 (for downstream processing)
- Create computed attributes (batch aggregations)
```

**What Query Service is NOT**:
- NOT a federated query engine (cannot query BigQuery, Snowflake directly)
- NOT used for real-time segmentation (too slow, 10-minute timeout)
- NOT a replacement for ETL (still need to ingest data into AEP first)

**Comparison**:

| Feature | AEP Query Service | BigQuery Federated Queries |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Query External Data | No (only AEP Data Lake) | Yes (GCS, Drive, Cloud SQL) |
| Latency | 5-600 seconds | 1-30 seconds |
| Use Case | Analytics on ingested data | Query data in-place without ingestion |
| Cost | $$$ (premium add-on) | $ (included in BigQuery) |

#### 2.5.4 Adobe's Business Reasons for Not Supporting Federated Queries

Beyond technical constraints, there are business reasons Adobe doesn't support federated queries:

**1. Data Gravity = Platform Lock-in**

```
Adobe's Business Model:
- Get customers to ingest data into AEP
- Data residency creates switching costs (hard to migrate away)
- Federated queries would reduce lock-in (data stays in customer's warehouse)

Example:
- Customer A: Stores 100TB of data in AEP Data Lake
  - Switching cost: High (must migrate 100TB + rebuild pipelines)
  - Adobe retention: High

- Customer B (hypothetical federated model): Stores 100TB in BigQuery, AEP queries it
  - Switching cost: Low (just change which CDP queries BigQuery)
  - Adobe retention: Low (easy to switch to competitor)
```

**2. Revenue from Data Storage**

AEP charges for:
- Profile storage (per addressable profile)
- Data Lake storage (per GB ingested)
- Query Service compute (per query hour)

If AEP supported federated queries:
- Less data ingested into AEP Data Lake = lower storage revenue
- Customers use BigQuery for analytics = less Query Service revenue

**3. Competitive Differentiation**

AEP's value proposition:
- "Unified customer profile" (requires data ingestion to unify)
- "Real-time segmentation" (requires optimized local storage)
- "Identity resolution" (requires proprietary graph database)

Federated queries would commoditize AEP:
- If AEP just queries external data, what's different from Segment/mParticle?
- AEP becomes "just another activation API" (lower perceived value)

#### 2.5.5 Analysis: Federated Queries as a Zero-Copy Pattern (Hypothetical)

**If AEP supported federated queries, here's how it would work**:

**Hypothetical Architecture**:
```
GCP BigQuery (Master Profile Store)
  - Full customer profiles (100+ attributes)
  - Transaction history
  - Behavioral events
    |
    | NO data transfer
    V
AEP Federated Query Layer (hypothetical)
  - Virtual profile schema (maps to BigQuery tables)
  - Segment definition: "leadClassification = 'hot'"
  - Translates to: SELECT customer_id FROM bigquery.profiles WHERE leadClassification = 'hot'
    |
    | Query results (customer IDs)
    V
AEP Destinations
  - Activate customer IDs to Marketo, Google Ads
  - (Optional) Enrich with full profiles from BigQuery
```

**Performance Implications** (hypothetical):

| Metric | AEP Current (Ingested Data) | AEP Hypothetical (Federated) |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Segment Evaluation** | 5-30 minutes (batch), <1 sec (streaming) | 10-60 seconds (BigQuery query) |
| **Profile Lookup** | <100ms | 1-30 seconds (network + BigQuery) |
| **Data Transfer** | Full profile ingestion (GB-TB) | Zero (query in-place) |
| **Identity Resolution** | Real-time graph traversal (<100ms) | Not possible (requires local graph DB) |
| **Complex Segments** | Fast (pre-built indexes) | Slow (ad-hoc BigQuery joins) |

**Cost Implications** (hypothetical):

| Cost Category | AEP Current | AEP Hypothetical (Federated) |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **AEP Licensing** | $50K-$150K/month | $20K-$50K/month (lower value = lower price) |
| **Data Storage** | AEP Data Lake ($$$) | BigQuery ($) - cheaper |
| **Query Compute** | AEP Query Service ($$$) | BigQuery ($) - cheaper |
| **Data Transfer** | GCP egress ($) | Zero |
| **Total** | High | Medium (but AEP offers less value) |

**Functionality Limitations** (hypothetical):

Even if AEP supported federated queries, these features would NOT work:

1. **Real-Time Customer Profile**: Cannot achieve <100ms lookup with remote queries
2. **Streaming Segmentation**: Cannot evaluate segments in <1 second with external DB queries
3. **Identity Graph**: Graph databases require local storage (cannot federate graph traversal)
4. **Edge Segmentation**: Edge nodes cannot query central BigQuery (latency, cost)
5. **Customer AI**: ML models require co-located data (cannot train on remote data efficiently)

**What Would Still Work**:

1. **Batch Segmentation**: BigQuery is fast enough for daily segment evaluation
2. **Destination Activation**: Customer IDs can be sent to destinations (enriched from BigQuery)
3. **Analytics**: Query Service equivalent (just query BigQuery directly)

#### 2.5.6 Comparison: Federated Queries vs Recommended Patterns

**Pattern Comparison Table**:

| Pattern | Data Location | Zero-Copy? | AEP Supported? | Performance | Cost | Functionality |
|---------|---------------|------------|----------------|-------------|------|---------------|
| **Federated Query (ideal)** | BigQuery only | Yes | **NO** | Slow (1-30s) | Low | Limited (no real-time profile, no identity graph) |
| **Computed Attributes (Pattern 1)** | BigQuery + AEP (minimal) | No (minimal transfer) | Yes | Fast (AEP optimized) | Medium | Full AEP features |
| **Reference Architecture (Pattern 2)** | BigQuery + AEP (stubs) | No (stubs only) | Yes | Medium (enrichment lag) | Medium | Limited (segment on stubs only) |
| **Event-Driven (Pattern 3)** | BigQuery + AEP (events) | No (events copied) | Yes | Fast (streaming) | Medium-High | Limited (no persistent profiles) |
| **Hybrid Batch+Stream (Pattern 4)** | BigQuery + AEP (selective) | No (selective transfer) | Yes | Fast (optimized) | Medium | Full AEP features |

**Decision Framework**:

```
Do you need <100ms profile lookups (web personalization)?
  |
  YES --> Federated queries won't work. Use Pattern 1 or 4 (ingest into AEP).
  |
  NO --> Continue
  |
Do you need real-time segmentation (<1 second)?
  |
  YES --> Federated queries won't work. Use Pattern 1 or 4 (streaming ingestion).
  |
  NO --> Continue
  |
Do you need identity resolution across devices/channels?
  |
  YES --> Federated queries won't work. Use Pattern 1 or 4 (AEP identity graph).
  |
  NO --> You don't need AEP. Use GCP-native (BigQuery + direct destination APIs).
```

#### 2.5.7 Workarounds and Alternatives

Since AEP doesn't support federated queries, here are alternatives to achieve similar goals:

**Workaround 1: Query Service + Scheduled Exports**

```
Architecture:
  BigQuery (Master Data)
    --> Daily batch ingestion to AEP Data Lake
    --> AEP Query Service: Create computed views
    --> Export results to GCS
    --> Destinations read from GCS

Pros:
- Minimal data in AEP (only aggregated views)
- Use SQL (familiar to data teams)

Cons:
- Still requires ingesting data into AEP (not zero-copy)
- Query Service is expensive
- 24-hour latency (daily batch)
```

**Workaround 2: External Data Enrichment via APIs**

```
Architecture:
  AEP Segment Membership
    --> Export to GCS (customer IDs)
    --> Cloud Function: Fetch full profiles from BigQuery
    --> Send to Destinations (enriched profiles)

Pros:
- Minimal data in AEP (just customer IDs + segment flags)
- Full profiles stay in BigQuery (data sovereignty)

Cons:
- Cannot use full profile data for segmentation (only IDs in AEP)
- Adds latency (enrichment step)
- Complex to maintain (external orchestration)
```

**Workaround 3: Reverse ETL Pattern (Census, Hightouch)**

```
Architecture:
  BigQuery (Source of Truth)
    --> Reverse ETL Tool (Census/Hightouch)
    --> Syncs computed attributes to AEP (via API)
    --> AEP segments on synced attributes
    --> Destinations

Pros:
- Business logic stays in SQL (BigQuery)
- Declarative sync (no custom code)
- Minimal data in AEP (only attributes needed for segmentation)

Cons:
- Third-party tool cost ($10K-$50K/year)
- Still requires copying data to AEP (not zero-copy)
- Another system to maintain
```

**Alternative: Skip AEP Entirely (GCP-Native)**

If federated queries are a requirement, consider:

```
Architecture:
  BigQuery (Segmentation Logic)
    --> Cloud Composer (Orchestration)
    --> Direct API integrations to Destinations:
        - Marketo API
        - Google Ads Customer Match API
        - Salesforce Bulk API

Pros:
- True zero-copy (no data movement to external CDP)
- Full control over data and logic
- Lower cost (no AEP licensing)
- BigQuery = federated query system (can query GCS, Drive, Cloud SQL)

Cons:
- Must build/maintain destination integrations (engineering effort)
- No unified identity resolution (unless you build it)
- No real-time profile store (cannot do <100ms lookups)
```

**When to Use Each Approach**:

| Your Requirement | Recommended Approach |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Must use AEP + minimize data transfer | Pattern 1: Computed Attributes (Section 2.1) |
| Need data sovereignty (data stays in BigQuery) | Pattern 2: Reference Architecture (Section 2.2) |
| Need real-time activation | Pattern 4: Hybrid Batch + Streaming (Section 2.4) |
| Want SQL-based segmentation | Workaround 1: Query Service or GCP-native |
| Want to avoid vendor lock-in | GCP-native (no AEP) |
| Need <100ms profile lookups | Must ingest into AEP (no alternative) |

#### 2.5.8 Should You Advocate for Federated Queries with Adobe?

**Short Answer**: Yes, but don't expect it soon.

**Adobe's Roadmap Reality**:

Adobe is aware of customer demand for federated queries, but:

1. **Technical Complexity**: Would require re-architecting core AEP components (Profile Store, Segmentation Engine, Identity Graph)
2. **Timeline**: If started today, 3-5 years to productionize (enterprise-scale is hard)
3. **Priority**: Adobe is focused on AI features (GenAI, Customer AI enhancements) over infrastructure changes
4. **Competitive Pressure**: Snowflake, Databricks are building CDP features with native federated queries (competitive threat)

**What You Can Do**:

1. **Provide Feedback to Adobe Account Team**:
   - "We want federated query support to reduce data transfer and vendor lock-in"
   - Explain your use case: "We have 100TB in BigQuery, ingesting into AEP is costly and slow"
   - Ask for roadmap visibility: "Is this on the roadmap? What's the timeline?"

2. **Feature Request via Adobe UserVoice**:
   - Adobe tracks feature requests via community forums
   - Upvote existing requests or create new one
   - More customer demand = higher priority

3. **Contract Negotiations**:
   - If federated queries are critical, negotiate:
     - Pilot period (3-6 months) to evaluate AEP with minimal commitment
     - Data export rights (ensure you can leave if federated queries never arrive)
     - Price concessions (argue that data ingestion costs should be lower)

**Honest Assessment**:

Don't hold your breath for federated queries in AEP. Adobe's business model depends on data ingestion, and the technical lift is massive. Instead:

- **Short-term (0-2 years)**: Use Pattern 1 (Computed Attributes) to minimize data transfer
- **Medium-term (2-5 years)**: Monitor Adobe roadmap, but have exit strategy ready
- **Long-term (5+ years)**: Consider alternatives (Snowflake Native App for CDPs, Databricks Delta Sharing) if AEP doesn't evolve

#### 2.5.9 Competitive Landscape: Platforms That DO Support Federated Queries

**Why This Matters**: Understanding what's possible elsewhere helps evaluate AEP's limitations.

**Snowflake Native Apps for CDP**:

```
Architecture:
  Snowflake (Customer Data Warehouse)
    --> Install CDP Native App (e.g., Hightouch, Census)
    --> Segmentation logic runs IN Snowflake (no data export)
    --> Activation to Destinations (via API)

Key Difference:
- Data NEVER leaves Snowflake
- CDP queries customer's tables directly (true federated query)
- Customer controls schema (no XDM lock-in)

Pros:
- True zero-copy (no data movement)
- Customer owns data and logic
- Lower cost (no CDP data storage fees)

Cons:
- No real-time profile store (<100ms lookups)
- No proprietary identity graph (must build yourself)
- Limited to batch segmentation (not streaming)
```

**Databricks Delta Sharing for CDPs**:

```
Architecture:
  Databricks (Customer Lakehouse)
    --> Delta Sharing: Share tables with CDP (read-only)
    --> CDP queries shared tables (no data copy)
    --> Activation to Destinations

Key Difference:
- CDP reads from customer's lakehouse via Delta Sharing protocol
- Customer controls access (can revoke at any time)
- Zero data replication

Pros:
- Zero-copy (true federated query)
- Customer maintains full control
- Works across clouds (share Databricks tables with GCP/Azure CDP)

Cons:
- Emerging ecosystem (fewer CDP vendors support Delta Sharing)
- Latency higher than AEP's local storage
```

**Google BigQuery + Reverse ETL**:

```
Architecture:
  BigQuery (Source of Truth)
    --> Hightouch/Census: Syncs ONLY computed attributes
    --> Destinations (Marketo, Google Ads, etc.)

Key Difference:
- Segmentation logic stays in BigQuery (SQL)
- Reverse ETL tool is thin sync layer (not full CDP)
- Minimal vendor lock-in (can swap Reverse ETL tools easily)

Pros:
- Business logic in SQL (portable, familiar)
- Cheap (Reverse ETL tools: $10K-$50K/year vs AEP: $50K-$150K/year)
- Flexible (no schema lock-in)

Cons:
- No identity resolution (must build yourself)
- No real-time activation (batch only, hourly at best)
- Must build destination integrations (or use Reverse ETL connectors)
```

**Comparison Table**:

| Platform | Zero-Copy? | Real-Time Profile? | Identity Graph? | Cost (10K profiles) | Vendor Lock-in |
|----------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **AEP** | No | Yes (<100ms) | Yes (proprietary) | $50K-$150K/year | High (XDM schema) |
| **Snowflake Native CDP** | Yes | No (seconds) | No (DIY) | $20K-$50K/year | Medium (SQL schema) |
| **Databricks Delta Share** | Yes | No (seconds) | No (DIY) | $20K-$50K/year | Low (open format) |
| **BigQuery + Reverse ETL** | Partial | No (minutes) | No (DIY) | $10K-$30K/year | Low (SQL, swap tools) |

#### 2.5.10 Key Takeaways: Federated Queries and AEP

**What You Need to Know**:

1. **AEP does NOT support federated queries** - This is a fundamental architectural limitation, not a feature gap that will be fixed soon.

2. **Technical Reasons**:
   - AEP's Real-Time Profile requires local storage for <100ms lookups
   - Segmentation engine relies on pre-built indexes (external queries too slow)
   - Identity graph requires specialized graph database (cannot federate)

3. **Business Reasons**:
   - Data ingestion creates vendor lock-in (Adobe's business model)
   - Federated queries would commoditize AEP (lower perceived value)

4. **Alternatives to Achieve Zero-Copy Goals**:
   - Pattern 1 (Computed Attributes): 95% data reduction vs full replication
   - GCP-native architecture: True zero-copy, but no AEP features
   - Reverse ETL (Hightouch/Census): Middle ground (SQL-based, portable logic)

5. **When AEP Still Makes Sense Despite No Federated Queries**:
   - You need <100ms profile lookups (web/app personalization)
   - You need streaming segmentation (<1 second evaluation)
   - You need cross-device identity resolution (proprietary graph)
   - You value Adobe-managed destination connectors (saves engineering effort)

6. **When to Avoid AEP**:
   - Your primary requirement is zero-copy (impossible with AEP)
   - You can build destination integrations in-house (GCP-native cheaper)
   - You want to avoid vendor lock-in (keep logic in BigQuery)
   - Budget-constrained (Reverse ETL tools 50-70% cheaper)

**Final Recommendation**:

For your GCP + BigQuery environment:

```
If you must use AEP:
  --> Use Pattern 1 (Computed Attributes from GCP)
  --> 95% data reduction (not zero-copy, but close)
  --> Keep scoring logic in BigQuery (portable, not locked into AEP)

If you can avoid AEP:
  --> Use BigQuery + Reverse ETL (Hightouch/Census)
  --> 50-70% cheaper than AEP
  --> True portability (swap Reverse ETL tools easily)
  --> Segmentation logic stays in SQL (familiar, maintainable)
```

The honest truth: If federated queries are a hard requirement, AEP is not the right platform. Advocate for the feature with Adobe, but plan your architecture assuming it won't exist for 3-5 years (if ever).

## 3. GCP-to-AEP Integration Patterns

### 3.1 Integration Method Comparison

| Method | Latency | Cost (AEP) | Cost (GCP) | Complexity | Use Case |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Streaming HTTP API** | 5-15 seconds | High ($) | Low | Low | Real-time events, immediate segmentation |
| **Batch API (GCS -> AEP)** | Hours | Low | Low | Medium | Daily/weekly profile updates |
| **AEP Source Connector (BigQuery)** | Hours | Medium | Medium | Low | Initial profile load, periodic sync |
| **Cloud Functions + Pub/Sub** | 5-30 seconds | High ($) | Low | Medium | Event-driven updates |
| **Dataflow Streaming** | 10-60 seconds | High ($) | High ($$) | High | Complex transformations at scale |
| **Dataflow Batch** | Hours | Low | Medium | Medium | ETL with aggregations |

### 3.2 Recommended Integration Architecture for Your Use Case

```
GCP Architecture:

  1. Data Sources:
     - Web analytics (GA4) --> BigQuery (streaming)
     - CRM (Salesforce) --> Cloud SQL
     - Mobile app events --> Firebase --> BigQuery
     - Transactional systems --> Cloud Spanner

  2. Unified Customer Profile (GCP):
     BigQuery:
       - Table: customer_master_profile (source of truth)
       - Table: behavioral_events (raw events)
       - Table: computed_lead_scores (daily refresh)

  3. Scoring Pipeline:
     Cloud Composer (Airflow):
       - DAG: daily_lead_scoring
       - Tasks:
         a. Aggregate events from last 30 days
         b. Run BigQuery ML model prediction
         c. Classify leads (cold/warm/hot)
         d. Write to computed_lead_scores table

  4. AEP Integration Layer:

     Option A - Batch (Daily):
       Dataflow Job (scheduled):
         - Read: computed_lead_scores WHERE updated_today = true
         - Transform: Convert to AEP XDM format
         - Write: AEP Batch Ingestion API (via GCS staging)

     Option B - Streaming (Real-time events):
       Cloud Function (triggered by Pub/Sub):
         - Filter: Only critical events (inquiries, callback requests)
         - Transform: Convert to AEP ExperienceEvent schema
         - Send: AEP Streaming HTTP API

  5. AEP Configuration:

     Real-Time Customer Profile:
       - Schema: Minimal Lead Profile (5-7 fields)
       - Datasets:
         a. Profile dataset (batch ingestion)
         b. Critical events dataset (streaming)
       - Identity: Email (primary), gcpCustomerId (cross-reference)

     Segments:
       - "Hot Leads": WHERE leadClassification = "hot"
       - "Warm Leads - High Propensity": WHERE leadClassification = "warm" AND propensityScore > 0.6
       - "Cold Leads - Recent Interaction": WHERE leadClassification = "cold" AND lastInteractionTimestamp > now() - 7 days

     Destinations:
       - Marketo (for nurture campaigns)
       - Google Ads (for retargeting)
       - Salesforce (for sales team routing)

  6. Activation Flow:
     AEP Segment Membership Change
       --> Destination (Marketo/Google Ads)
       --> (Optional) Webhook to GCP Cloud Function for enrichment
```

### 3.3 API vs SDK vs Connectors Decision Tree

**Use AEP Streaming HTTP API when**:
- Real-time events (latency < 30 seconds required)
- Custom transformation logic in GCP (Cloud Functions)
- Event volume < 10K events/second
- Direct control over payload format

**Use AEP Batch Ingestion API when**:
- Daily/weekly profile updates
- Large volume updates (millions of profiles)
- Cost optimization is priority
- Acceptable latency (hours)

**Use AEP Source Connector (BigQuery) when**:
- Initial profile load (one-time migration)
- Simple schema mapping (no complex transformations)
- You want AEP to manage ingestion scheduling
- You're okay with AEP reading from BigQuery (data egress costs)

**Avoid AEP SDK (Web/Mobile) when**:
- You already have event collection (GA4, Firebase)
- You don't need AEP's edge personalization
- Reduces vendor lock-in (SDK ties you to AEP's client-side architecture)

### 3.4 Data Residency and Compliance

**AEP Data Residency**:
- AEP data stored in Adobe-managed Azure regions (US, EU, APAC)
- **Critical**: Data leaves GCP, crosses cloud boundaries
- GDPR: Ensure Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with Adobe
- CCPA: AEP supports consumer deletion requests via API

**GCP-to-AEP Data Flow**:
```
GCP (Google Cloud Data Centers)
  |
  | HTTPS/TLS 1.3
  V
Adobe Experience Cloud (Azure-hosted)
  - US: Virginia (AWS East)
  - EU: Netherlands (Azure West Europe)
  - APAC: Australia (Azure Australia East)
```

**Minimizing Cross-Cloud Data Transfer**:
1. **Egress Costs**: GCP charges for data leaving GCP
   - Batch ingestion: Lower egress (fewer, larger transfers)
   - Streaming: Higher egress (many small transfers)
   - Cost: ~$0.12/GB egress from GCP to internet

2. **Compliance Strategy**:
   - Store PII in GCP (encrypted at rest)
   - Send only pseudonymized IDs + computed attributes to AEP
   - Example: Don't send `firstName`, `lastName`, `SSN` to AEP
   - Send: `hashedEmail`, `leadClassification`, `propensityScore`

---

## 4. Cold/Warm/Hot Lead Classification: Implementation Strategy

### 4.1 Recommended Architecture for Your Use Case

**Option 1: GCP-Computed Classification (RECOMMENDED)**

#### Why This Approach
- Your classification logic involves complex rules (relationship manager interactions, transaction patterns, engagement history)
- Changes frequently (business rules evolve)
- Requires explainability (sales teams need to understand why a lead is "hot")
- Leverages GCP's compute capabilities (BigQuery ML, complex joins)

#### Implementation

**Step 1: Define Classification Logic in BigQuery**

```sql
-- File: lead_classification_query.sql
-- Run daily in Cloud Composer

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `project.dataset.computed_lead_scores` AS
WITH
  -- Engagement metrics
  engagement AS (
    SELECT
      customer_id,
      COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(event_timestamp)) AS days_active_last_30d,
      SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'product_detail_view' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS product_views,
      SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'webinar_registration' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS webinar_registrations,
      MAX(event_timestamp) AS last_interaction_timestamp
    FROM `project.dataset.behavioral_events`
    WHERE event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    GROUP BY customer_id
  ),

  -- Relationship manager interactions
  rm_interactions AS (
    SELECT
      customer_id,
      COUNT(*) AS rm_touchpoints_last_90d,
      MAX(interaction_date) AS last_rm_contact
    FROM `project.crm.relationship_manager_log`
    WHERE interaction_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
    GROUP BY customer_id
  ),

  -- Transaction patterns
  transactions AS (
    SELECT
      customer_id,
      SUM(transaction_amount) AS total_transaction_value_last_90d,
      AVG(transaction_amount) AS avg_transaction_value,
      COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
    FROM `project.financial.transactions`
    WHERE transaction_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
    GROUP BY customer_id
  ),

  -- Propensity model prediction
  ml_predictions AS (
    SELECT
      customer_id,
      predicted_conversion_probability
    FROM ML.PREDICT(
      MODEL `project.dataset.lead_propensity_model`,
      (SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.customer_features`)
    )
  )

-- Classification logic
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.email,
  c.relationship_manager_id,

  -- Raw metrics (for debugging/analysis, not sent to AEP)

  COALESCE(t.total_transaction_value_last_90d, 0) AS transaction_value,
  COALESCE(ml.predicted_conversion_probability, 0.0) AS propensity_score,

  -- Computed classification (THIS is what gets sent to AEP)
  CASE
    -- HOT LEAD: High propensity + recent activity + explicit intent signals
    WHEN ml.predicted_conversion_probability > 0.7
         AND e.last_interaction_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
         AND (e.webinar_registrations > 0 OR rm.rm_touchpoints_last_90d > 2)
    THEN 'hot'

    -- WARM LEAD: Moderate propensity OR growing engagement
    WHEN ml.predicted_conversion_probability > 0.4
         OR (e.days_active_last_30d >= 3 AND e.product_views >= 5)
         OR (t.transaction_count > 0 AND t.total_transaction_value_last_90d > 10000)
    THEN 'warm'

    -- COLD LEAD: Low propensity and minimal engagement
    ELSE 'cold'
  END AS lead_classification,

  -- Engagement index (0-100 score, useful for sub-segmentation)
  CAST(
    LEAST(100,
      (COALESCE(e.days_active_last_30d, 0) * 2) +
      (COALESCE(e.product_views, 0) * 1) +
      (COALESCE(rm.rm_touchpoints_last_90d, 0) * 5) +
      (COALESCE(ml.predicted_conversion_probability, 0) * 50)
    ) AS INT64
  ) AS engagement_index,

  -- Primary product interest (derived from recent behavior)
  (
    SELECT product_category
    FROM `project.dataset.behavioral_events`
    WHERE customer_id = c.customer_id
      AND event_type = 'product_detail_view'
      AND event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
    GROUP BY product_category
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 1
  ) AS primary_product_interest,

  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS computed_at

FROM `project.dataset.customer_master_profile` c
LEFT JOIN engagement e ON c.customer_id = e.customer_id
LEFT JOIN rm_interactions rm ON c.customer_id = rm.customer_id
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
LEFT JOIN ml_predictions ml ON c.customer_id = ml.customer_id

        }

        # Wrap in AEP Batch format

             file_name_suffix='.json')
        )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_pipeline()
```

**Step 4: AEP Segment Configuration**

In AEP UI (or via Segment API):

```
Segment: "Hot Leads - Immediate Follow-up"
Definition:
  Profile.leadClassification = "hot"
  AND Profile.lastComputedTimestamp >= now() - 1 day

Segment: "Warm Leads - High Propensity"
Definition:
  Profile.leadClassification = "warm"
  AND Profile.propensityScore > 0.6

Segment: "Cold Leads - Re-engagement Campaign"
Definition:
  Profile.leadClassification = "cold"
  AND Profile.engagementIndex < 20
  AND Profile.lastComputedTimestamp >= now() - 7 days
```

**Data Transfer Summary**:
- **BigQuery -> GCS**: Full computed_lead_scores table (~1-5 MB for 10K customers)
- **GCS -> AEP**: Only XDM-formatted profiles (~2-3 KB per profile)
- **Daily Transfer**: ~20-30 MB for 10K customers
- **Frequency**: Once daily (not continuous replication)

---

**Option 2: AEP Customer AI (Alternative, NOT RECOMMENDED for your use case)**

**Why NOT Recommended**:
- Requires 12+ months of historical data in AEP (you'd need to backfill)
- Black box model (no control over classification logic)
- Expensive (Customer AI is a premium add-on)
- Less flexible (can't easily incorporate RM interaction data)
- Vendor lock-in (scoring logic tied to AEP)

**When Customer AI Makes Sense**:
- You don't have data science capabilities
- You want Adobe to manage model training/maintenance
- Your use case is standard (churn, conversion propensity)
- You're already storing all behavioral data in AEP

**Implementation (if forced to use Customer AI)**:

```
1. Ingest 12 months of behavioral events to AEP (LARGE data transfer)
2. Configure Customer AI:
   - Goal: Predict "product_inquiry" event within 30 days
   - Influencing factors: web interactions, email engagement
3. Wait 24-48 hours for model training
4. Use AI-generated propensity scores in segments:
   Segment: Profile.customerAI.propensityScore > 0.7
```

**Cost**: Customer AI licensing (~$50K-$100K+ annually depending on profile volume)

### 4.2 Real-Time vs Batch Scoring Trade-offs

| Approach | Latency | Cost | Accuracy | Complexity | Best For |
|----------|---------|------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Batch (Daily)** | 24 hours | Low | High (full data) | Low | Lead nurturing, campaign planning |
| **Streaming (Real-time)** | <1 minute | High | Medium (recent data only) | High | Immediate follow-up, live chat routing |
| **Micro-batch (Hourly)** | 1 hour | Medium | High | Medium | Balance of cost and timeliness |
| **Hybrid (Batch + Trigger)** | 24h base + <1m for triggers | Medium | High | Medium | **RECOMMENDED** for your use case |

**Recommended: Hybrid Approach**

```
Batch (Daily):
  - Compute lead classification for ALL customers
  - Update AEP profiles once per day
  - Used for: Email campaigns, sales prioritization

Real-time Triggers (Event-driven):
  - Monitor for high-intent events:
    * Callback request submitted
    * Webinar registration
    * Credit application started
  - Immediately update lead classification to "hot"
  - Trigger: AEP destination (Salesforce alert to RM)

Implementation:
  Cloud Function (Pub/Sub trigger):
    IF event_type IN ('callback_request', 'webinar_registration'):
      1. Stream event to AEP (real-time)
      2. Override lead_classification to "hot" (temporary)
      3. Next daily batch will recompute (permanent classification)
```

---

## 5. Honest Assessment: When AEP is (and isn't) the Right Choice

### 5.1 For Your Use Case (Lead Classification + Activation)

**AEP is a GOOD fit if**:
- You need to activate segments to multiple destinations (Marketo, Google Ads, Salesforce)
- You want Adobe-managed destination connectors (avoid building custom integrations)
- You're using other Adobe tools (Adobe Analytics, Target, Campaign) and want unified identity
- Your organization has already licensed AEP (sunk cost)

**AEP is a POOR fit if**:
- Your primary goal is lead scoring (GCP tools are more flexible and cost-effective)
- You need real-time scoring (AEP adds latency; direct GCP-to-destination is faster)
- You want to avoid vendor lock-in (AEP's proprietary XDM schema is hard to migrate from)
- Budget-constrained (AEP licensing is expensive; consider alternatives below)

### 5.2 Alternative Architectures to Consider

#### Alternative 1: GCP-Native (No AEP)

```
BigQuery (Scoring)
  --> Cloud Composer (Orchestration)
  --> Destinations (Direct API integrations):
      - Marketo API (lead scoring)
      - Google Ads Customer Match API
      - Salesforce Bulk API

Pros:
  - No AEP licensing costs
  - Full control over data and logic
  - No vendor lock-in
  - Lower latency (fewer hops)

Cons:
  - Build and maintain destination integrations
  - No unified identity resolution (unless you build it)
  - Requires engineering resources
```

**Cost Comparison** (10K profiles, monthly):
- AEP: $10K-$50K/month (licensing + compute)
- GCP-native: $500-$2K/month (BigQuery + Dataflow + Cloud Functions)

**Recommendation**: If you have engineering capacity, GCP-native is more cost-effective for lead scoring.

---

#### Alternative 2: Segment (CDP Alternative)

```
GCP BigQuery
  --> Segment Profiles API (sync computed scores)
  --> Segment Destinations (200+ pre-built integrations)

Pros:
  - Lighter than AEP (designed for data routing, not storage)
  - Faster implementation (no XDM schema design)
  - More flexible (supports custom traits)
  - Lower cost (~$5K-$20K/month vs $50K+ for AEP)

Cons:
  - Less sophisticated identity resolution than AEP
  - No built-in AI/ML (like Customer AI)
  - Limited Adobe ecosystem integration
```

**When to Use Segment Instead of AEP**:
- You don't need AEP's AI features (Customer AI, Attribution AI)
- You prioritize speed to market over advanced capabilities
- You want to avoid Adobe ecosystem lock-in
- Your use case is primarily "route data to destinations" (not profile unification)

---

#### Alternative 3: Hybrid (GCP + Lightweight CDP)

```
GCP BigQuery (Master Profile Store)
  |
  +-- Lead Scoring (Batch)
  |     --> mParticle / Segment (just for activation)
  |
  +-- Real-time Events
        --> Google Analytics 4
        --> Firebase (mobile)
        --> Direct to Google Ads API

Philosophy:
  - GCP = Source of truth (profile data, scoring logic)
  - CDP = Thin activation layer (routing scores to destinations)
  - No unnecessary data replication
```

**Data Minimization**:
- CDP stores: customer_id + lead_classification + propensity_score (3 fields)
- GCP stores: Full profile (100+ fields)
- Updates: Only when classification changes (not every event)

---

### 5.3 AEP Limitations You Must Understand

#### 5.3.1 Identity Resolution Limitations

**Identity Graph Limits**:
- Max 50 identities per person (email, phone, cookie IDs, etc.)
- Performance degrades above 20 identities per profile
- Cross-device stitching requires Adobe Analytics or third-party data (Liveramp)

**Impact**: If your customers have many devices/touchpoints, identity graph may be incomplete.

**Workaround**: Perform identity resolution in GCP (Dataflow + BigQuery), send stitched ID to AEP.

---

#### 5.3.2 Segmentation Latency

**Streaming Segmentation**:
- Evaluated in <1 minute (for qualifying events)
- **BUT**: Only ~20-30 attributes supported for streaming evaluation
- Complex segments (multi-entity, historical lookups) fall back to batch

**Batch Segmentation**:
- Evaluated every 24 hours (not configurable to more frequent)
- Can include full profile history and complex joins

**Impact**: "Hot lead" classification computed daily won't update in AEP until next batch run.

**Workaround**: Use streaming ingestion to override classification for critical events (see hybrid approach above).

---

#### 5.3.3 Query Service Performance

**Limitations**:
- 10-minute query timeout
- Limited compute resources (not designed for heavy analytics)
- Expensive ($$$) compared to BigQuery

**Impact**: Complex lead scoring queries may time out in Query Service.

**Recommendation**: Do NOT run ML or complex aggregations in AEP Query Service. Use BigQuery, send results to AEP.

---

#### 5.3.4 API Rate Limits

**Streaming Ingestion**:
- 20,000 requests/second per organization (seems high, but...)
- Throttling at 100 profiles/request recommended (20K profiles/sec max)
- **Real limit**: Concurrent connection limits (often hit before rate limit)

**Batch Ingestion**:
- No strict rate limit (file size limits: 512 MB per file)
- Processed asynchronously (1-2 hours typical)

**Impact**: Real-time event streaming at scale requires careful architecture (batching, retry logic).

---

#### 5.3.5 Cost Opacity

**AEP Pricing Model** (as of 2024):
- **Licensing**: Per "addressable profile" (profiles eligible for activation)
  - Tier 1: $10K-$50K/month (up to 100K profiles)
  - Tier 2: $50K-$150K/month (100K-1M profiles)
- **Add-ons**:
  - Customer AI: +$20K-$50K/month
  - Query Service: +$5K-$20K/month
  - Additional sandboxes: +$5K/month each
- **Overage Charges**: $0.50-$2.00 per profile above tier limit

**Hidden Costs**:
- Implementation services (Adobe charges $50K-$200K for Professional Services)
- Data Lake storage (charges per GB stored)
- Destination activation fees (some partners charge per activation)

**Cost Surprise**: Many organizations underestimate total cost by 2-3x.

**Example**:
- Expected: $50K/month licensing
- Actual: $50K licensing + $30K Customer AI + $10K Query Service + $40K implementation services = $130K/month

---

### 5.4 Vendor Lock-in Considerations

**High Lock-in Risk Areas**:

1. **XDM Schema**: Proprietary to Adobe, can't export to another CDP without re-mapping
2. **Customer AI Models**: Trained on AEP data, can't migrate to another platform
3. **Destination Connectors**: Some connectors (Adobe Advertising Cloud) only work with AEP
4. **Identity Graphs**: Proprietary format, can't export

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Maintain Parallel Source of Truth**:
   - GCP BigQuery = master profile store
   - AEP = activation layer only
   - All business logic (scoring, segmentation) in GCP (portable)

2. **Avoid Proprietary Features**:
   - Don't use Customer AI (use GCP Vertex AI instead)
   - Don't use AEP's journey orchestration (use Campaign or Marketo)
   - Minimize use of AEP-specific schema extensions

3. **Design for Portability**:
   - Document XDM -> Standard mapping (e.g., XDM to Segment Traits)
   - Keep GCP pipelines independent of AEP
   - Test activation to non-Adobe destinations (Google Ads, Marketo) to prove portability

4. **Contract Negotiations**:
   - Negotiate data export rights in contract
   - Ensure API access to export profiles and segments
   - Avoid multi-year locks (annual renewals preferred)

---

## 6. Recommended Architecture for Your Use Case

Based on analysis, here's my recommendation:

### 6.1 Phase 1: Minimal Viable AEP (3 months)

**Goal**: Prove value with minimal data transfer and vendor lock-in.

**Architecture**:
```
GCP BigQuery (Source of Truth)
  - Compute lead classification (cold/warm/hot) daily
  - Batch update to AEP (via Dataflow + Batch API)

AEP Real-Time Customer Profile
  - Minimal schema (5-7 fields):
    * customer_id (identity)
    * email (identity)
    * leadClassification (enum)
    * propensityScore (number)
    * engagementIndex (integer)
    * primaryProductInterest (enum)
    * relationshipManagerId (string)

AEP Segments (3 core segments)
  - "Hot Leads" (for immediate RM outreach)
  - "Warm Leads" (for nurture campaigns)
  - "Cold Leads - Re-engagement" (for win-back campaigns)

AEP Destinations (start with 2-3)
  - Marketo (nurture campaigns)
  - Google Ads (retargeting)
  - Salesforce (RM notifications)
```

**Data Transfer**:
- **Daily batch**: ~20-30 MB for 10K profiles
- **No streaming** (start simple, add later if needed)

**Success Metrics**:
- Lead conversion rate improvement
- Time-to-activation (how fast segments reach destinations)
- Cost per activated profile

**Decision Point**: After 3 months, evaluate if AEP's value justifies cost. If not, migrate to GCP-native or Segment.

---

### 6.2 Phase 2: Add Real-Time Triggers (if needed)

**Only if Phase 1 shows value**, add real-time streaming for critical events:

**Architecture Addition**:
```
GCP Pub/Sub (Real-time Events)
  - Monitor: callback_requested, webinar_registration, high_value_transaction
  - Trigger: Cloud Function

Cloud Function
  - Stream critical events to AEP (Streaming API)
  - Override lead_classification to "hot" (temporary)

AEP Streaming Segment
  - "Hot Leads - Immediate Action" (evaluates in <1 minute)

Destination
  - Salesforce API (alert RM in real-time)
```

**Incremental Cost**:
- +$1K-$5K/month (streaming API calls)

---

### 6.3 Phase 3: Optimize or Exit

**After 6-12 months, decide**:

**Option A: Double Down on AEP**
- Add Customer AI (if GCP ML models aren't sufficient)
- Expand to journey orchestration (Customer Journey Optimizer)
- Integrate Adobe Analytics for better identity resolution

**Option B: Migrate Away from AEP**
- If cost > value, migrate to GCP-native or Segment
- AEP becomes "activation only" layer with minimal data
- Keep scoring logic in GCP (already portable)

**Decision Criteria**:
- **Stay with AEP if**: Destination connectors save >$50K/year in engineering effort
- **Leave AEP if**: Total cost > $100K/year and you can build GCP-native for <$50K

## 8. Key Takeaways and Decision Framework

### 8.1 Core Principles for Zero-Copy with AEP

1. **Accept Reality**: True zero-copy is impossible with AEP. Aim for data minimization instead.
2. **Compute in GCP, Activate in AEP**: Keep business logic portable, use AEP as activation layer.
3. **Start Minimal**: Begin with 5-7 profile attributes, not 100+. Add more only if necessary.
4. **Batch Over Streaming**: Default to daily batch updates (cheaper). Add streaming selectively.
5. **Maintain Parallel Systems**: GCP = source of truth. AEP = cache for activation.

### 8.2 Decision Tree: Should We Use AEP?

```
START: Do we need to activate segments to multiple destinations?
  |
  NO --> Don't use AEP. Use GCP-native (BigQuery + direct API integrations)
  |
  YES --> Continue
  |
  Do we have budget for AEP ($50K-$150K/year)?
  |
  NO --> Use Segment or mParticle (lighter CDP, $5K-$30K/year)
  |
  YES --> Continue
  |
  Do we need Adobe ecosystem integration (Analytics, Target, Campaign)?
  |
  YES --> AEP is a good fit (unified identity is valuable)
  |
  NO --> Continue
  |
  Can we build destination integrations in-house?
  |
  YES --> GCP-native is more cost-effective (avoid AEP)
  |
  NO --> Use AEP for destination connectors (value = saved engineering effort)
```

### 8.3 When to Walk Away from AEP

**Red Flags** (consider alternatives):
- Adobe pushing multi-year contract without pilot
- Implementation requires >6 months (AEP should be faster)
- Total cost > $200K/year and you're not using AI features
- Your use case is purely lead scoring (GCP Vertex AI is better)
- You need sub-second latency (AEP is not real-time enough)

### 8.4 Final Recommendation for Your Use Case

**My Honest Assessment**:

For your Cold/Warm/Hot lead classification use case:

**Best Architecture**:
```
GCP BigQuery (Lead Scoring)
  -> AEP (Minimal Profile)
  -> Destinations (Marketo, Google Ads, Salesforce)
```

**Why This Works**:
- GCP handles complex scoring logic (flexible, cost-effective)
- AEP provides destination connectors (saves engineering time)
- Minimal data in AEP (reduces vendor lock-in)
- Daily batch updates (cost-optimized)

**Data Transfer**:
- 20-30 MB/day for 10K profiles (5-7 fields per profile)
- 95% reduction vs full profile replication

**Cost Estimate** (annual):
- AEP licensing: $60K-$100K/year (10K profiles)
- GCP compute: $10K-$20K/year (BigQuery + Dataflow)
- Implementation: $50K-$100K (one-time)
- **Total Year 1**: $120K-$220K
- **Total Year 2+**: $70K-$120K/year

**ROI Calculation**:
- If destination integrations would cost >$50K/year to build (2-3 destinations), AEP pays for itself
- If lead conversion improves >5%, AEP likely justifies cost
- If you can't build/maintain integrations, AEP provides operational efficiency

**Alternative** (if budget-constrained):
```
GCP BigQuery (Lead Scoring)
  -> Segment (Activation Layer) - $20K-$40K/year
  -> Destinations
```
- 50-70% cheaper than AEP
- Faster implementation (weeks vs months)
- Less sophisticated identity resolution (acceptable for B2B lead scoring)

            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Design Principles**:
- **Namespace custom fields**: Use `_{TENANT}` prefix to avoid conflicts
- **Use enums for classifications**: Better for segment performance
- **Add descriptions**: Essential for marketing team to understand fields
- **Avoid nested arrays**: AEP segmentation performance degrades with complex nesting
- **Keep it flat**: Max 2-3 levels of nesting

### 9.3 Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue 1: Batch Ingestion Fails**
```
Error: "XDM schema validation failed"

Causes:
- Data type mismatch (e.g., string sent for number field)
- Missing required fields (_id, timestamp for events)
- Identity map format incorrect

Solution:
1. Validate JSON against schema before sending
2. Check AEP batch status API for detailed error:
   GET https://platform.adobe.io/data/foundation/catalog/batches/{BATCH_ID}
3. Review sample failed records in AEP UI (Monitoring tab)
```

**Issue 2: Segment Not Updating**
```
Symptom: Profile updated but segment membership unchanged

Causes:
- Batch segment evaluation runs once per 24 hours (not immediate)
- Profile not enabled for dataset (check dataset config)
- Merge policy issues (check profile merge timestamp)

Solution:
1. Check segment evaluation schedule:
   GET https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/ups/segment/jobs
2. Force segment evaluation (not recommended for production):
   POST https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/ups/segment/jobs
3. Switch to streaming segment (if <30 attributes)
```

**Issue 3: Identity Resolution Not Working**
```
Symptom: Same customer appearing as multiple profiles

Causes:
- Identity namespace not configured
- Identity map missing "primary": true flag
- Cross-device stitching requires Adobe Analytics or third-party data

Solution:
1. Verify identity namespaces exist:
   GET https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/idnamespace/identities
2. Check identity graph for a profile:
   GET https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/identity/cluster/members?{identity}
3. Review merge policy configuration (ensure correct identity precedence)
```

## 10. Conclusion

**Zero-copy with AEP is an oxymoron**. AEP's architecture requires data residency for profile unification and segmentation. **AEP does not support federated queries** to external data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake), which would be the only true zero-copy approach. However, **data minimization is achievable** through strategic design:

**Key Strategy**:
- **Compute in GCP** (leverage BigQuery ML, Dataflow for scoring)
- **Transfer computed attributes only** (lead_classification, not raw events)
- **Use AEP as activation layer** (destination connectors, not analytics)
- **Maintain GCP as source of truth** (reduce vendor lock-in)

**For your Cold/Warm/Hot lead use case**:
- **Recommended**: GCP-computed scores + minimal AEP profile + batch daily updates
- **Data transfer**: 95% reduction vs full profile replication
- **Cost**: $70K-$120K/year (ongoing) for 10K profiles
- **Alternative**: GCP-native or Segment (if AEP cost exceeds value)

**Final Advice**:
Start with a **3-month pilot** using minimal data. Measure value (lead conversion improvement, operational efficiency). If ROI is positive, expand. If not, you've minimized sunk cost and can pivot to alternatives with minimal migration effort (since business logic stays in GCP).

**Questions to Ask Adobe Sales**:
1. What's the total cost for 10K profiles (licensing + AI features + overages)?
2. Can we pilot with 1K profiles for 3 months? (test before commitment)
3. What's the data export process if we want to leave AEP? (contractual right to export)
4. What are batch segment evaluation SLAs? (understand latency limitations)
5. Can we bring our own ML models (instead of Customer AI)? (yes, via API)
6. Is federated query support on the roadmap? If not, why not? (understand Adobe's position on zero-copy)

**Red Flags in Adobe Sales Conversation**:
- Pressure to sign multi-year deal without pilot
- Vague pricing ("depends on use case" - demand firm pricing)
- Overselling Customer AI (most companies don't need it)
- Claiming "real-time" without clarifying batch vs streaming segment limits

**Good Signs**:
- Adobe offers sandbox access for POC
- Transparent about limitations (segment latency, API rate limits)
- Willing to start small (1K-10K profiles pilot)
- Solutions architect assigned (technical support, not just sales)
